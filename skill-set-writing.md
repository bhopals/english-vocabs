### Chapter 2 - VOCABULARY SKILLS

- words and expressions are the building blocks of language
- NOUNS

  - Nouns and verbs are fundamental to a sentence.
  - Nouns are essentailly the names of PERSONS, PLACES, THINGS, ANUMALS, IDEAS
  - Examples - `girl`, `house`, `desk`, `cow`, `beauty`
  - TYPES:

    - CONCRETE NOUNS (`stone`, `chairs`)
    - ABSTRACT NOUNS (`love`, `trust`)
    - PROPER NOUNS (`Bhopal`, `India`)
    - COLLECTIVE NOUNS (`staff`, `team`)
    - COMPOUND NOUNS (`lunch break`, `mini-bar`, `webpage`, `girlfriend`, `book-case`)
    - UNCOUNTABLE NOUNS
      - These nouns are not generally pluralized or used with indefinite articles (a, an).
      - They include liquids (`milk`, `water`), gases (`air`, `helium`), things that are in
        grains (`sand`, `salt`), and abstract qualities (`beauty`, `truth`).
      - Some tricky uncountable nouns are:
      - `advice`, `clothing`, `equipment`, `furniture`, `information`, `mail`, `paper`,
        `news`, `research`, `software`, `time`, `luggage`, and `work`

  - Some uncountable nouns have an expression that can be used when you want a countable item.
    For example, you can ask for `a piece of advice` or `a slice of a bread` or `a loaf of bread`
  - You CANNOT say - you have many works, but can say - I can have many chores, jobs, tasks.

  - Pronouns takes places of NOUNS and refer to them.

    - Examples
      - I, me, my, mine, myself
      - you, your, yours, yourself
      - he, she, it, him, her, his, hers, its, himself, herself, itself
      - we, us, our, ours, ourselves
      - they, them, their, theirs, themselves

  - POSITION OF NOUNS

    - Nouns are crucial to a sentence. They tell what is being talked about.
    - Nouns can be:

      - THE SUBJECT OF THE SENTENCE
      - THE OBJECT OF THE VERB
      - THE OBJECT OF THE PREPOSITIONAL PHRASES

    - Nouns appear after DETERMINERS

      - a, an, the, this, that, these, those, my, your, his, her, its, our, their
      - Examples
        - the house, a boy, his book, their names, this boat
        - their former names, this expensive boat

    - Adjectives may come in between the DETERMINER and the NOUN

      - Examples
        - the old house, the red-haired boy, his only book
        - their former names, this expensive boat

    - Note, However, that nouns can often functions as adjectives, sometimes forming compound forms:

      - Examples
        - grocery store, biology book, garage door opener, bus stop

    - Nouns can be plural (more than one) as well as singular (one)
      - Mostly plurals are formed:
      - `-s`, `-es`, `-ves`, `-ies`

- VERBS

  - Verbs are words that describe actions (jump, swim, wave) or state (be, seem, signify)
  - AUXILIARY VERBS

    - The verb in a sentence may be more than one word, For example, the auxiliary (helping)
      verbs `be` and `have` part of the verb in the perfect and continuous tenses.
    - Modal verbs (`could`, `should`, `may`, `would`) can also be the part of the verb

  - Active and passvie
  - PHRASAL VERBS

    - Some verbs are completed by one or two adverbial particles, commonly known as perpositions.
      - She `slept in` and missed the class, so then she `fell behind` and had trouble `cathing up`.
      - I `got up` at noon, but I was still tired.

  - VERBALS

    - Words that are based on verbs but do not function as main verbs are called VERBALS.

    - PARTICIPLES.

      - ACTIVE PARTICIPLES (end in `-ing`) - show that person/thing is doing something.
        - The group `performing` next is the favorite to win the competition.

        - `Waiting` around is more difficult than doing something.
        - `Dancing` is great exercise.

    - There is no definite grammar rule that explains why some verbs require the gerund and some the infinitive.
      Sometimes HYPOTHETICAL, UNFULFILLED IDEAS tend to be expressed with the INFINITIVES, while REAL
      HAPPENINGS tend to be found with the greund.
      - Examples
        - I `hope to complete` a marathon this year (hypothetical, a wish)

  - They also appear after the VERB `to be` and other verbs that describe the state of something
    - Examples

### Chapter 3 - SENTENCE WRITING SKILLS

- Words are combined to make SENTENCES, and SENTENCES are combined to make PARAGRAPH.
- PARAGRAPHS form parts of essays, reports, letters or any other forms of writing.

- UNDERSTANDING BASIC SENTENCE STRUCTURES

  - EXAMPLE Sentence Patterns

    - John fled [subject + intransitive verb]
    - The opened the package [subject + transitive verb + direct object]
    - Ahmed gave her a ring [subject + verb + indirect object + direct object]
    - Yuki is an architect [subject + linking verb + predicate noun or adjective]
    - She painted the room blue [subject + verb + direct object + objective complemented]
    - The house is over there [subject + verb + adverbial phrase]

  - The SUBJECT is a NOUN, NOUN PHRASE, or NOUN CLAUSE

    - EXAMPLES
      - The `house` on the cornet is slated for demolition.[single word subject]
      - `Walking to the school` is one of the ways I get my exercise [Noun phrase as subject]
      - `That he ruined the day for his family` did not seem to enter his mind.[noun clause as subject]
      - `Jack, Amir, and Tim` enjoyed the pumpkin pie.[compound subject]

  - VERBS can be more than one word - auxiliary verbs along with the main verb.

    - In a sentence a PREDICATE can include more than one verb.
    - EXAMPLES
      - He `should have bee`n more careful.
      - He `could have been` electrocuted.
      - The children `ran`, `skipped`, and `hopped` across the field.

  - AUXILIARY VERBS

    - Helping verbs and they may be followed by another verb.
    - The auxiliaries `be`, `have`, and `will` are used to make several of the tenses.
    - Other auxiliaries include `do` and the modal verbs (`may`, `might`, `can`, `could`, `should`, `would`)
    - The verbs `be`, `have`, `do`, and `will` can also be used as simple verbs without another verbs.
    - However, the Modal Verbs can never be used alone.

  - TRANSITIVE and INTRANSITIVE VERBS

    - A Transitive Verb requires a Direct Object(DO) to complete it.
    - Examples
      - I `saw`(V) `five whales`(DO).
      - He `denied`(V) `the accussation`(DO).
      - I `have`(V) `change for a twenty`(DO).
    - Many verbs can be used both TRANSITIVELY or INTRANSITIVELY

    - A mistake that many people make is using verbs that are not normally found in passive voice, such
      as INTRASITIVE VERBS or the verbs that express STATE. Both cannot be used in passive voice as they
      do not have any direct object. THEREFORE, only TRANSITIVE verbs can be used in passive voice because
      the direct object becomes the subject in the passive.

  - SINGULAR and PLURAL

    - The determiners such as `a`, `an`, `another`, `each`, `every`, `this`, and `that` are SINGULAR.
    - The determiners `these` and `those` are PLURAL.
    - Words that end in `-one`, `-thing`, `-body`(`everybody`, `anybody`) are SINGULAR.

  - ACTIVE and PASSIVE VOICE

    - In Active voice, the subject does the action of the verb.
    - In Passive Voice, the subject is acted upon.

  - DETERMINERS

    - Determiners are the words that come before the noun to identify which person, place or thing is talked about.
    - Determiner include:
      - ARTICLES - `a`, `an`, `the` (`A`, `AN` - INDEFINITE Article, `THE` - DEFINITE Article)
      - DEMONSTRATIVES - `this`, `that`, `these`, `those`
      - POSSESSIVE FORMS - `my`, `your`, `his`, `her`, `its`, `our`, `their`
      - RELATIVE PRONOUNS - `which`, `whose`, `what`
      - INDEFINITE DETERMINERS - `few`, `many`, `more`, `serveral`, `some`
    - Remenber that INDEFINITE Articles (a, an) cannot be used with uncountable nouns.
    - Quantifiers such as `many` and `few` are used with COUNTABLE NOUNS.
    - UNCOUNTABLE NOUNS take `much`, `some`, and `little`

    - `few` and `little` can be used with the INDEFINITE Article `a` but the meaning changes slightly.
      - It changes from NEGATIVE to POSITIVE
      - EXAMPLE
        - I have `a little` time now to look at your essay.
          - Means I can look at it now as I have some time. It is a POSITIVE Statement.
        - I have `little` time now to look at your essay.
          - Means I can't look at it now as I donot have time. It is a NEGATIVE Statement.
        - `A few` students understood that complicated problem.
          - Means more students than expected to understand the problem (POSITIVE SENSE)
        - `Few` students understood that complicated problem.
          - Means the problem will have to be presented again. (NEGATIVE SENSE)
        - There is a littler water left; we probably have enough. (POSITIVE)
        - There is little water left, so we should get more. (NEGATIVE)

  - PREPOSTIONAL PHRASES

    - Prepositional Phrases are a frequest add-in to the basic sentence structure.
    - Most speccify time or place (`When` or `Where`).
    - Some show the manner (`How` something was done).
    - They are formed with a preposition followed by a NOUN PHRASE(a noun with articles and adjectives if required.)
    - Examples (Prepostional Phrases)
      - `dress up`
      - `contend with`
      - `rely on`
    - PREPOSTIONS

      - `about`, `above`, `across`, `after`, `against`, `along`, `among`, `around`, `at`
      - `before`, `behind`, `below`, `beneath`, `beside`, `between`, `by`, `down`
      - `during`, `except`, `for`, `from`, `in`, `inside`, `into`, `near`, `next to`, `of`, `off`
      - `on`, `onto`, `out of`, `outside`, `over`, `past`, `through`, `to`, `under`, `until`
      - `up`, `upon`, `with`, `within`, `without`

  - COORDINATE CONJUNCTIONS

  - FANBOYS (`for`, `and`, `nor`, `because`, `or`, `yet`, `so`)

  - PARALLEL STRUCTURE

    - When using co-ordinate conjucntion, you MUST ENSURE that each sentence part
      that you join has essentially the same grammatically structure.
      and that is caller PARALLEL STRUCTURE.

  - WRITING NOUN CLAUSE

    - Clauses that are part of complex sentences and have both a NOUN and a VERB.
    - NOUN CLAUSE functions as a NOUN. It can act as the `SUBJECT`, `OBJECT`, and the `SUBJECT COMPLEMENT`.
    - EXAMPLES

      - `His behaviour` was inexcusable. [noun subject]
      - `What he did` was inexcusable. [noun clauses subject]

      - I understood `his apology`. [noun object]
      - I understood `that he was sorry`. [noun clause object]

    - WORDS that may Begin NOUN CLAUSES:

      - `that`, `if`, `whether`, `when`, `where`, `what`, `why`, `how`, `who`, `whom`, `which`, `whose`

    - EXAMPLES (Noun Clauses as a SUBJECT or OBJECT)

      - She asked `whether I could come`.
      - They wondered `if it would rain`.
      - The school accepts `whoever wants to attend`.
      - I do not understand `how they fixed it`.
      - `Who will win the race` is a mystery.

    - Many noun clauses that begin with `that` (never `which`), but if the clause comes after the VERB,
      the `that` can be eliminated (OPTIONAL), if the sentence is clear without it.

      - Example
        - She realized [`that`] he was late.

    - BE CAREFUL with the word order in noun clause that deal with QUESTION.
      The question structure (using the verb `do` and INVERTED word order) is NOT USED.

      - EXAMPLES

        - They asked what time `did` she finished. [INCORRECT]
        - They asked what time she finished [CORRECT]

        - They wanted to know did she have time for another project. [INCORRECT]
        - They wanted to know if she had time for another proeject. [CORRECT]

  - NOUN CLAUSE as the SUBJECT:

    - `What my friend did` was unbelievable.
    - `What Carol said` shocked all of us.

  - NOUN CLAUSE as the OBJECT:

    - DO you know `how much this will cost?`
    - I didn’t know `that he could sing so well`.

  - NOUN CLAUSE as the OBJECT of a PREPOSITION:

    - We are not responsible for `what they did`.
    - You can give this to `whoever you like`.

  - NOUN CLAUSE as the SUBJECT COMPLEMENT:
    - `Whichever option you choose` is fine with us.
    - Your problem is `that you don’t have faith in God`.

- WRITING ADJECTIVE CLAUSE

  - Adjective clause functions as an ADJECTIVES and modifies the noun.
  - A Clause is, in effect, another sentence added into a sentence, since it has both a SUBJECT and a VERB.
  - Adjective Claues also called RELATIVE CLAUSES, describes a NOUN
    and are introduced by RELATIVE PRONOUNS - (`who`, `what`, `whose`, `which`, `why`, `that`, `when`, `where`)
  - EXAMPLES

    - The woman `who led that protest march` is Jamie's cousin.
    - The reason `that I am so tired` is that I stayed up all night finishing the essay.
    - The cottage road, `which is not paved`, is impassible in the winter.
    - The DVD `that he ordered` is not available anymore.
    - The tourist `whose luggage was stolen` spent hours filling out a report.

  - Adding clauses to a sentence is a good way to give extra information to a sentence
    without changing its main idea.
