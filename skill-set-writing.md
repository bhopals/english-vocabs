### Chapter 2 - VOCABULARY SKILLS

- words and expressions are the building blocks of language
- NOUNS

  - Nouns and verbs are fundamental to a sentence.
  - Nouns are essentailly the names of PERSONS, PLACES, THINGS, ANUMALS, IDEAS
  - Examples - `girl`, `house`, `desk`, `cow`, `beauty`
  - TYPES:

    - CONCRETE NOUNS (`stone`, `chairs`)

    - COMPOUND NOUNS (`lunch break`, `mini-bar`, `webpage`, `girlfriend`, `book-case`)
    - UNCOUNTABLE NOUNS
      - These nouns are not generally pluralized or used with indefinite articles (a, an).
      - They include liquids (`milk`, `water`), gases (`air`, `helium`), things that are in
        grains (`sand`, `salt`), and abstract qualities (`beauty`, `truth`).

      - `advice`, `clothing`, `equipment`, `furniture`, `information`, `mail`, `paper`,
        `news`, `research`, `software`, `time`, `luggage`, and `work`

  - Some uncountable nouns have an expression that can be used when you want a countable item.
    For example, you can ask for `a piece of advice` or `a slice of a bread` or `a loaf of bread`
  - You CANNOT say - you have many works, but can say - I can have many chores, jobs, tasks.

  - POSITION OF NOUNS

    - Nouns are crucial to a sentence. They tell what is being talked about.
    - Nouns can be:

      - THE SUBJECT OF THE SENTENCE
      - THE OBJECT OF THE VERB
      - THE OBJECT OF THE PREPOSITIONAL PHRASES

    - Nouns appear after DETERMINERS

      - a, an, the, this, that, these, those, my, your, his, her, its, our, their
      - Examples
        - the house, a boy, his book, their names, this boat

### Chapter 3 - SENTENCE WRITING SKILLS

- Words are combined to make SENTENCES, and SENTENCES are combined to make PARAGRAPH.
- PARAGRAPHS form parts of essays, reports, letters or any other forms of writing.

- UNDERSTANDING BASIC SENTENCE STRUCTURES

  - EXAMPLE Sentence Patterns

    - John fled [subject + intransitive verb]
    - The opened the package [subject + transitive verb + direct object]
    - Ahmed gave her a ring [subject + verb + indirect object + direct object]
    - Yuki is an architect [subject + linking verb + predicate noun or adjective]
    - She painted the room blue [subject + verb + direct object + objective complemented]
    - The house is over there [subject + verb + adverbial phrase]

  - The SUBJECT is a NOUN, NOUN PHRASE, or NOUN CLAUSE

    - EXAMPLES
      - The `house` on the cornet is slated for demolition.[single word subject]
      - `Walking to the school` is one of the ways I get my exercise [Noun phrase as subject]
      - `That he ruined the day for his family` did not seem to enter his mind.[noun clause as subject]
      - `Jack, Amir, and Tim` enjoyed the pumpkin pie.[compound subject]

  - VERBS can be more than one word - auxiliary verbs along with the main verb.

    - In a sentence a PREDICATE can include more than one verb.
    - EXAMPLES
      - He `should have bee`n more careful.
      - He `could have been` electrocuted.
      - The children `ran`, `skipped`, and `hopped` across the field.

  - AUXILIARY VERBS

    - Helping verbs and they may be followed by another verb.
    - The auxiliaries `be`, `have`, and `will` are used to make several of the tenses.
    - Other auxiliaries include `do` and the modal verbs (`may`, `might`, `can`, `could`, `should`, `would`)
    - The verbs `be`, `have`, `do`, and `will` can also be used as simple verbs without another verbs.
    - However, the Modal Verbs can never be used alone.

  - TRANSITIVE and INTRANSITIVE VERBS

    - A Transitive Verb requires a Direct Object(DO) to complete it.
    - Examples
      - I `saw`(V) `five whales`(DO).
      - He `denied`(V) `the accussation`(DO).
      - I `have`(V) `change for a twenty`(DO).
    - Many verbs can be used both TRANSITIVELY or INTRANSITIVELY

    - A mistake that many people make is using verbs that are not normally found in passive voice, such
      as INTRASITIVE VERBS or the verbs that express STATE. Both cannot be used in passive voice as they
      do not have any direct object. THEREFORE, only TRANSITIVE verbs can be used in passive voice because
      the direct object becomes the subject in the passive.

  - SINGULAR and PLURAL

    - The determiners such as `a`, `an`, `another`, `each`, `every`, `this`, and `that` are SINGULAR.
    - The determiners `these` and `those` are PLURAL.
    - Words that end in `-one`, `-thing`, `-body`(`everybody`, `anybody`) are SINGULAR.

  - ACTIVE and PASSIVE VOICE
    - In Active voice, the subject does the action of the verb.
    - In Passive Voice, the subject is acted upon.

- VOCABS
  - quite comfortable talking about the use of verb tenses and uncountable nouns.
  - Questions about grammar are not simple, black-and-white questions.
  - black-and-white questions
  - Grammar, like other aspescts of language, evolves and changes over time.
  - What is considered ACCEPTABLE in casual speech may be considered INCORRECT in standard academic writing.
  - Underachieving young men
  - children should learn financial responsibility
  - show appreciation
