### Chapter 2 - VOCABULARY SKILLS

- words and expressions are the building blocks of language
- NOUNS

  - Nouns and verbs are fundamental to a sentence.
  - Nouns are essentailly the names of PERSONS, PLACES, THINGS, ANUMALS, IDEAS
  - Examples - `girl`, `house`, `desk`, `cow`, `beauty`
  - TYPES:

    - CONCRETE NOUNS (`stone`, `chairs`)
    - ABSTRACT NOUNS (`love`, `trust`)
    - PROPER NOUNS (`Bhopal`, `India`)
    - COLLECTIVE NOUNS (`staff`, `team`)
    - COMPOUND NOUNS (`lunch break`, `mini-bar`, `webpage`, `girlfriend`, `book-case`)
    - UNCOUNTABLE NOUNS
      - These nouns are not generally pluralized or used with indefinite articles (a, an).
      - They include liquids (`milk`, `water`), gases (`air`, `helium`), things that are in
        grains (`sand`, `salt`), and abstract qualities (`beauty`, `truth`).
      - Some tricky uncountable nouns are:
      - `advice`, `clothing`, `equipment`, `furniture`, `information`, `mail`, `paper`,
        `news`, `research`, `software`, `time`, `luggage`, and `work`

  - Some uncountable nouns have an expression that can be used when you want a countable item.
    For example, you can ask for `a piece of advice` or `a slice of a bread` or `a loaf of bread`
  - You CANNOT say - you have many works, but can say - I can have many chores, jobs, tasks.

  - Pronouns takes places of NOUNS and refer to them.

    - Examples

      - you, your, yours, yourself
      - he, she, it, him, her, his, hers, its, himself, herself, itself
      - we, us, our, ours, ourselves
      - they, them, their, theirs, themselves

  - POSITION OF NOUNS

    - Nouns are crucial to a sentence. They tell what is being talked about.
    - Nouns can be:

      - THE SUBJECT OF THE SENTENCE
      - THE OBJECT OF THE VERB
      - THE OBJECT OF THE PREPOSITIONAL PHRASES

    - Nouns appear after DETERMINERS

      - a, an, the, this, that, these, those, my, your, his, her, its, our, their
      - Examples
        - the house, a boy, his book, their names, this boat
        - their former names, this expensive boat

    - Adjectives may come in between the DETERMINER and the NOUN

      - Examples
        - the old house, the red-haired boy, his only book
        - their former names, this expensive boat

    - Note, However, that nouns can often functions as adjectives, sometimes forming compound forms:

      - Examples
        - grocery store, biology book, garage door opener, bus stop

    - Nouns can be plural (more than one) as well as singular (one)
      - Mostly plurals are formed:
      - `-s`, `-es`, `-ves`, `-ies`

- VERBS

  - Verbs are words that describe actions (jump, swim, wave) or state (be, seem, signify)
  - AUXILIARY VERBS

    - The verb in a sentence may be more than one word, For example, the auxiliary (helping)
      verbs `be` and `have` part of the verb in the perfect and continuous tenses.
    - Modal verbs (`could`, `should`, `may`, `would`) can also be the part of the verb

  - Active and passvie
  - PHRASAL VERBS

    - Some verbs are completed by one or two adverbial particles, commonly known as perpositions.
      - She `slept in` and missed the class, so then she `fell behind` and had trouble `cathing up`.
      - I `got up` at noon, but I was still tired.

  - VERBALS

    - Words that are based on verbs but do not function as main verbs are called VERBALS.
    - They include PARTICIPLE, INFINITIVES, and GERUNDS
    - PARTICIPLES.

      - ACTIVE PARTICIPLES (end in `-ing`) - show that person/thing is doing something.
        - The group `performing` next is the favorite to win the competition.
      - PASSIVE PARTICPLES (end in `-ed`) - show that something is being done to someone or something.
        - The `elected` officials were sworn in on Tuesdays.

    - INFINITIVES

      - An infinitive is the simple, base form of the verb, with or without `to`
      - Examples
        - He seemed `to shrink` before my eyes.
        - I need another computer program `to do` the editing.
        - She helped them `reorganize` the whole department.

      - Examples
        - `Waiting` around is more difficult than doing something.
        - `Dancing` is great exercise.

    - There is no definite grammar rule that explains why some verbs require the gerund and some the infinitive.
      Sometimes HYPOTHETICAL, UNFULFILLED IDEAS tend to be expressed with the INFINITIVES, while REAL
      HAPPENINGS tend to be found with the greund.
      - Examples
        - I `hope to complete` a marathon this year (hypothetical, a wish)

### Chapter 3 - SENTENCE WRITING SKILLS

- Words are combined to make SENTENCES, and SENTENCES are combined to make PARAGRAPH.
- PARAGRAPHS form parts of essays, reports, letters or any other forms of writing.

- UNDERSTANDING BASIC SENTENCE STRUCTURES

  - EXAMPLE Sentence Patterns

    - John fled [subject + intransitive verb]
    - The opened the package [subject + transitive verb + direct object]
    - Ahmed gave her a ring [subject + verb + indirect object + direct object]
    - Yuki is an architect [subject + linking verb + predicate noun or adjective]
    - She painted the room blue [subject + verb + direct object + objective complemented]
    - The house is over there [subject + verb + adverbial phrase]

  - The SUBJECT is a NOUN, NOUN PHRASE, or NOUN CLAUSE

    - EXAMPLES
      - The `house` on the cornet is slated for demolition.[single word subject]
      - `Walking to the school` is one of the ways I get my exercise [Noun phrase as subject]
      - `That he ruined the day for his family` did not seem to enter his mind.[noun clause as subject]
      - `Jack, Amir, and Tim` enjoyed the pumpkin pie.[compound subject]

  - VERBS can be more than one word - auxiliary verbs along with the main verb.

    - In a sentence a PREDICATE can include more than one verb.
    - EXAMPLES
      - He `should have bee`n more careful.
      - He `could have been` electrocuted.
      - The children `ran`, `skipped`, and `hopped` across the field.

  - AUXILIARY VERBS

    - Helping verbs and they may be followed by another verb.
    - The auxiliaries `be`, `have`, and `will` are used to make several of the tenses.
    - Other auxiliaries include `do` and the modal verbs (`may`, `might`, `can`, `could`, `should`, `would`)
    - The verbs `be`, `have`, `do`, and `will` can also be used as simple verbs without another verbs.
    - However, the Modal Verbs can never be used alone.

  - TRANSITIVE and INTRANSITIVE VERBS

    - A Transitive Verb requires a Direct Object(DO) to complete it.
    - Examples
      - I `saw`(V) `five whales`(DO).
      - He `denied`(V) `the accussation`(DO).
      - I `have`(V) `change for a twenty`(DO).
    - Many verbs can be used both TRANSITIVELY or INTRANSITIVELY

    - A mistake that many people make is using verbs that are not normally found in passive voice, such
      as INTRASITIVE VERBS or the verbs that express STATE. Both cannot be used in passive voice as they
      do not have any direct object. THEREFORE, only TRANSITIVE verbs can be used in passive voice because
      the direct object becomes the subject in the passive.

  - SINGULAR and PLURAL

    - The determiners such as `a`, `an`, `another`, `each`, `every`, `this`, and `that` are SINGULAR.
    - The determiners `these` and `those` are PLURAL.
    - Words that end in `-one`, `-thing`, `-body`(`everybody`, `anybody`) are SINGULAR.

  - ACTIVE and PASSIVE VOICE

    - In Active voice, the subject does the action of the verb.
    - In Passive Voice, the subject is acted upon.

  - DETERMINERS

    - Determiners are the words that come before the noun to identify which person, place or thing is talked about.
    - Determiner include:
      - ARTICLES - `a`, `an`, `the` (`A`, `AN` - INDEFINITE Article, `THE` - DEFINITE Article)
      - DEMONSTRATIVES - `this`, `that`, `these`, `those`
      - POSSESSIVE FORMS - `my`, `your`, `his`, `her`, `its`, `our`, `their`
      - RELATIVE PRONOUNS - `which`, `whose`, `what`
      - INDEFINITE DETERMINERS - `few`, `many`, `more`, `serveral`, `some`
    - Remenber that INDEFINITE Articles (a, an) cannot be used with uncountable nouns.
    - Quantifiers such as `many` and `few` are used with COUNTABLE NOUNS.
    - UNCOUNTABLE NOUNS take `much`, `some`, and `little`

    - `few` and `little` can be used with the INDEFINITE Article `a` but the meaning changes slightly.
      - It changes from NEGATIVE to POSITIVE
      - EXAMPLE
        - I have `a little` time now to look at your essay.
          - Means I can look at it now as I have some time. It is a POSITIVE Statement.
        - I have `little` time now to look at your essay.
          - Means I can't look at it now as I donot have time. It is a NEGATIVE Statement.
        - `A few` students understood that complicated problem.
          - Means more students than expected to understand the problem (POSITIVE SENSE)
        - `Few` students understood that complicated problem.
          - Means the problem will have to be presented again. (NEGATIVE SENSE)
        - There is a littler water left; we probably have enough. (POSITIVE)
        - There is little water left, so we should get more. (NEGATIVE)

  - PREPOSTIONAL PHRASES

    - Prepositional Phrases are a frequest add-in to the basic sentence structure.
    - Most speccify time or place (`When` or `Where`).
    - Some show the manner (`How` something was done).
    - They are formed with a preposition followed by a NOUN PHRASE(a noun with articles and adjectives if required.)
    - Examples (Prepostional Phrases)
      - `dress up`
      - `contend with`
      - `rely on`
    - PREPOSTIONS

      - `about`, `above`, `across`, `after`, `against`, `along`, `among`, `around`, `at`
      - `before`, `behind`, `below`, `beneath`, `beside`, `between`, `by`, `down`
      - `during`, `except`, `for`, `from`, `in`, `inside`, `into`, `near`, `next to`, `of`, `off`
      - `on`, `onto`, `out of`, `outside`, `over`, `past`, `through`, `to`, `under`, `until`
      - `up`, `upon`, `with`, `within`, `without`

  - COORDINATE CONJUNCTIONS

  - FANBOYS (`for`, `and`, `nor`, `because`, `or`, `yet`, `so`)

  - PARALLEL STRUCTURE

    - When using co-ordinate conjucntion, you MUST ENSURE that each sentence part
      that you join has essentially the same grammatically structure.
      and that is caller PARALLEL STRUCTURE.

  - WRITING NOUN CLAUSE

    - Clauses that are part of complex sentences and have both a NOUN and a VERB.
    - NOUN CLAUSE functions as a NOUN. It can act as the `SUBJECT`, `OBJECT`, and the `SUBJECT COMPLEMENT`.
    - EXAMPLES

      - `His behaviour` was inexcusable. [noun subject]
      - `What he did` was inexcusable. [noun clauses subject]

      - I understood `his apology`. [noun object]
      - I understood `that he was sorry`. [noun clause object]

    - WORDS that may Begin NOUN CLAUSES:

      - `that`, `if`, `whether`, `when`, `where`, `what`, `why`, `how`, `who`, `whom`, `which`, `whose`

- Tsunami

  - Say tsunami and up pops a mental image of a single, gian wave rising out of the ocean to swallow cities whole.
  - They are the result of oceans attempting to smooth out their surface after a disturbance.
  - Tsunamis are triggered by any phenomenon that causes a large part of the water's surface to rise or drop
    relative to normal sea level. These events are usually the result of earthquakes occuring along undersea
    fault lines, the cracks in the Earth's crust between tectonic plates. When these plates collide and grind
    against each other, they can elevate, lower, or tilt major sections of the ocean floor, suddenly offsetting
    the level of water at the surface. The displaced water then rushes to level out, causing a tsunami.
    The waves travel outward in all direction from the place where the earthquake occured, just like the ripples
    created when a stone is thrown into a lake.

### Chapter 11 - The Environment

- Essay - The case against Bottled Water

  - Canadians have long been proud of the mighty rivers and beautiful lakes that make this country
    one of the greatest repositories of fresh water on the planet
  - It is a sad statement about our society that we are increasingly choosing to drink bottled water,
    often from foreign companies.
  - A recent study found that three in 10 Canadian households used bottled water as their main source of drinking water.
  - The study is surprising, as there are so many good reasons to avoid drinking bottled water
  - they think bottled water is safer and healthier than the tap water
  - advertising by bottled water companies - dominated by images of pristine glaciers and mountain streams - leaves
    consumers with that impression.
  - The reality is Canada's water supply - with rare exception - is extremely safe.
  - There are no evidence to support the belief that bottled water is any safer than tap water
  - Indeed, if anything, our tap water may well be safer and healthier than bottled varities.
  - The municipal water supply is more stringenty tested than bottled water supplies.
  - Municipal water supplies are inspected every day while bottled-water plants are inspected just once every three years
  - Consumers should also consider the safety and health risks posed by the bottles themselves.
  - A study found that PET bottles leach a dangerous toxin called antinomy into the water they contain.
  - The study found the rise of antinomy rise the longer water stays in the bottle
  - Before reaching out to the bottled water, people need to think about the serious environmental
    consequences of their water choice.
  - this includes release of millions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from manufacturing, transport,
    and marketing, which contributes to global warming; depleting of scarce energy and water resources;
    release of toxic chemicals into our air, land and water; and absorption of poisons into the food chain.
  - the energy required to produce water bottles in 2006 alone was so high - almost 17 million barrel of oil
    and created 2.5 million tons of carbon dioxide (in 2006 alone)
  - Producing water bottles consumes a huge amount of water too. its almost 3 liters water to produce a bottle.
  - it also takes energy to fill the bottles; ship them by truck, train, boat, or place to the consumer;
    refrigrate them; and recover, recycle, or dispose of the empty bottles
  - The total amount of energy used to provide a bottle of water to the consumer could be equal
    to filling 25 percent of that bottle with oil.
  - unfortunately, most empty bottles are thrown into the trash
  - these bottles don't just disappear - they either buried in the landfill or they are incenarted (/inˈsinəˌrātəd/)
  - the buried bottles take up to 1000 years to biodegrade and may leak toxic addictives into the groundwater
  - the incinarated bottles release toxic chemicals into our air.
  - moreover, some bottles make their way into our oceans, where they break into increasingly tiny pieces
    and can enter the food chain where they are eaten by marine animals and birds
  - the economics of bottled water are also as startling as the health and environmental considerations.
  - buying bottled water is an incredibly expensive habit.
  - As Pepsi was forced to admit last year, it takes the water they bottle directly from municipal water systems.
  - What is perhaps more galling is that not only is the consumer paying exorbitant prices for filtered tap water
    but the taxpayer is also heavily subsidizing these companies on the back end by allowing them to draw water
    from municipal systems that were build with their tax monies.
  - From a marketing perspective, bottled water is unquestionably one of the greatest success stories of modern times.
  - However, from a social, environmental, and economics perspective, the success of bottled water has created
    myriads of problems
  - bottled water companies
  - lessen environmental damage

- Essay - Battle of the Bag

  - advocate of plastic shopping bags
  - the once-ubiquitous plastic bag has quickly become an environmental bogeyman in Canada
  - citing concerns over litter and landfill, they launched the first municipal bylaw requiring all
    the stores to charge a five cents per bag to discourage their use
  - Tasked with uneviable job of defending plastic bags in the face of this momentum
  - 8 out of 10 Canadians reused their plastic shopping bags for household garbage or pet waste
  - it has become an emotional issue rather than a debate based on the facts
  - municipal efforts would be better directed towards recycling plastic rather than discouraging it's use.
  - the ardent environmentalist disputes the notion that bags are a minor issue.
  - From disposable coffee lids to consumer electronics
  - The plastic bag is a symbol of wasteful and gluttenous lifestyle. It all has to change
  - plastic bags are accounted for 8 percent of total marine litter
  - calling for a sweeping worldwide ban of "pointless" plastic bags
  - examine health implications of replacing plastic bags with reusable green bags.
  - the study provides strong evidence that reusable bags could pose a significant risk to the safety of food supply
    if used to transport food from store to home
  - reusable bags should be washed and discarded regularly.

- Essay - Living Green
  - most people want to follow environmentally friendly living habits, but they do not know what to do.
  - experts advice often coflicts and may not consider individual situations
  - Green alternatives may be impractical
  - For example, the weather, the design of cities, and long commuting distance often make cycling work
    impractical in Canada.
  - Citizens may dutifully separate recyclables from their garbage only to find out that city has no market for the
    items and they end up in landfill anyway.
  - Finally, the green alternatives are not always as good as advertised. For instance, compact fluroescent bulbs use
    less electricity but contain toxic mercury. Lighter fuel-efficient cars may break down earlier and have to be
    replaced sooner than heavier cars. It is clear that consumers must educate themselves about the choices the make.
  - How Canadians limit environmental damage
