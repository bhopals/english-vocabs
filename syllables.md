  - Examples
    - `ate`, `ice`, `tune`, `slope`, `strobe`, `these`

- 4. Vowel Combination Syllables

  - A Vowel combination syllable has a cluster of TWO or THREE vowels or a vowel-consonant unit with a sound particular to that unit.

### Dividing Words into Syllables

- There are four wasy to split up a word into a syllables:
- 1. Divide between two middle consonants

  - Split up words that have two middle consonants.
  - Examples
    - `hap/pen`, `bas/ket`, `let/ter`, `sup/per`, `din/ner`, `Den/nis`

- 2. Usually divide before a single middle consonant

  - When there is only one middle consonant, you usually divide it in front of it as in:
  - Examples
    - `o/pen`, `i/tem`, `e/vil`, `re/port`

- 3. Divide before the consonant that occur before an `-le` syllable

  - When you have a word that has the old-style spelling in which the `-le` sounds like `-el`,
    divide before the consonant that occurs before the `-le`
  - Examples
    - `a/ble`, `fum/ble`, `rub/ble`, `mum/ble`, `thi/stle`

- 4. Divide off any compound words, prefixes, suffixes, roots which have vowel sounds
  - Split off the parts of compound words like `sports/car`, `house/boat`
  - Divide off prefixes such as `un/happy`, `pre/paid`, `re/write`
  - Also divide off suffixes as in the words `farm/er`, `teach/er`, `hope/less`, `care/ful`

### Syllable Stress

- In a word with two or more syllables,
  - One syllable is STRESSED (Meaning it has a stronger and louder sound)
  - The other syllables are UNSTRESSED or WEAK (Means they are not said or pronounced as strongly or for as long as stressed syllables)
  - Example
    - pre-`pare`, sig-`ni`-fi-cance, com-`pu`-ter, in-con-`spic`-u-ous
