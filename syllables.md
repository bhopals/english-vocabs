## Vowels and Consonants RULES

### VOWELS

- A vowel is any sound with no audible noise produced by constriction in the vocal tract.
- 5 LETTERS (A, E, I, O, U) always represent a vowel.

### CONSONANTS

- A Consonant is a sound with audible noice produced by a constriction.
- There are 21 LETTERS(b,c,d,f,g,h,j,k,l,m,n,p,q,r,s,t,v,w,x,y,z) that usually represents a consonant.

### Six Kinds of Syllables

- There are six different kinds of syllables in English
- 1. Closed syllables

  - A Closed syllable has only `one VOWEL`, and it ends in a consonant.
  - Examples
    - `ask`, `truck`, `sock`, `stretch`, `twelfth`, `on`

- 2. Open syllables

  - An open syllable has only `one VOWEL`, and that vowel occurs at the end of the syllable.
  - Examples
    - `no`, `she`, `I`, `a`, `spry`

- 3. Silent syllables

  - A silent-e syllable ends in an `e`, has only one consonant before that `e`, and only one vowel before that consonant.
  - Examples
    - `ate`, `ice`, `tune`, `slope`, `strobe`, `these`

- 4. Vowel Combination Syllables

  - A Vowel combination syllable has a cluster of TWO or THREE vowels or a vowel-consonant unit with a sound particular to that unit.
  - Examples
    - `rain`, `day`, `see`, `veil`, `pie`, `piece`, `noise`, `toy`, `cue`, `true`

- 5. Vowel-R Syllables

  - A vowel-r syllable is one which includes:
    - Only one VOWEL followed by an `r`, OR
    - One VOWEL followed by an `r` which is followed by a silent `e`, OR
    - A VOWEL combination followed by an `r`
    - Examples
      - `car`, `or`, `care`, `ire`, `air`, `deer`

- 6. Consonant L-E Syllables
  - In these syllables, a consonant is followed by `le`
  - Examples
    - `bobble`, `circle`, `doodle`, `waffle`, `gigle`

### Dividing Words into Syllables

- There are four wasy to split up a word into a syllables:
- 1. Divide between two middle consonants

  - Split up words that have two middle consonants.
  - Examples
    - `hap/pen`, `bas/ket`, `let/ter`, `sup/per`, `din/ner`, `Den/nis`

- 2. Usually divide before a single middle consonant

  - When there is only one middle consonant, you usually divide it in front of it as in:
  - Examples
    - `o/pen`, `i/tem`, `e/vil`, `re/port`

- 3. Divide before the consonant that occur before an `-le` syllable

  - When you have a word that has the old-style spelling in which the `-le` sounds like `-el`,
    divide before the consonant that occurs before the `-le`
  - Examples
    - `a/ble`, `fum/ble`, `rub/ble`, `mum/ble`, `thi/stle`

- 4. Divide off any compound words, prefixes, suffixes, roots which have vowel sounds
  - Split off the parts of compound words like `sports/car`, `house/boat`
  - Divide off prefixes such as `un/happy`, `pre/paid`, `re/write`
  - Also divide off suffixes as in the words `farm/er`, `teach/er`, `hope/less`, `care/ful`

### Syllable Stress

- In a word with two or more syllables,
  - One syllable is STRESSED (Meaning it has a stronger and louder sound)
  - The other syllables are UNSTRESSED or WEAK (Means they are not said or pronounced as strongly or for as long as stressed syllables)
  - Example
    - pre-`pare`, sig-`ni`-fi-cance, com-`pu`-ter, in-con-`spic`-u-ous

### Linking Consonant to Vowel

- When a word ends in a CONSONANT sound, we often move the consonant sound to the begining of the next word if it
  starts with a VOWEL sound. Remember that it's the sound that matters.
  - Examples
    - Can I have a bit of eggs? / Ca-nI-ha-va-bi-to-fegg?
    - The `have` ends with `e` (vowel) but sound as (v) consonant, hence we linked it to the next word.

### Linking Vowel to Vowel

- When one word ends with a VOWEL sound and the next word begins with a vowel sound, we link the words
  with a sort of `W` or `Y` sound.
- If our lips are round at the end of the first word, we insert a `W` sound.
- Example
  - Who is / Who wis

### Rules about Long Vowels

- 1. When two vowels are together such as a double o `oo`, the long vowel sound `u` is used.
  - Example - `zoom`
- 2. This can also be used with (`ee`) to make the long vowel `e` sound and so on.
  - Example - `deep`
- 3. In most cases when there is an `e` at the end of the word, the vowel in the middle of the world will have a long vowel sound.
  - Example - `dance`
