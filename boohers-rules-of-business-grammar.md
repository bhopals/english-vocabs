## PART 1 - Verbosity About Verbs: The Big Blunders

- When it comes to sport, you know what thye say: no guts, no glory.
- We will try to tackle the troublesome verbs in the following chapters

### 1. Let's Dialogue About Verbing Words

- TURNING PERFECTLY FINE NOUNS INTO VERBS

- `-ing`

  - `trending`, `impacting`, `glabalizing`, `fast-tracking`, `complimenting`
  - Examples
    - Managers become particularly adept at `globalizing` new trends and `fast-tracking` their way around obstacles
    - Manager often `incentivize` outstanding performers by `complimenting` them

- `-ize`

  - `incentivize`, `downsized`, `right-sized`, `strategize`, `prioritize`
  - `operationalize`, `utilize`, `marginalize`, `institutionalize`, `mobilize`, `capitalize`
  - Examples
    - Manager often `incentivize` outstanding performers by `complimenting` them
    - Whether `down-sized` or `right-sized`, teams can
      - `strategize` organizational initiatives,
      - `prioritize` divisional goals,
      - `operationalize` tactical plans,
      - `utilize` their best resources,
      - `marginalize` any deficiencies in their system,
      - `institutionalize` project outcomes,
      - `optimize` their opportunities,
      - `mobilize` human talent,
      - `capitalize` on their investments

- Managers often `dialogue` about important projects and hope the entire team `nets` the essentials.

### 2. She Went Missing

- The following are not errors; they just weaken your writing, so always avoid it

  - Call and make a reservation (Call and `Reserve`)
  - Run a test to see if... (`Test` to see if...)
  - Carry out experiments to ... (`Experiment`)
  - Perform an analysis of ... (`Analyze`)
  - Provide for the elimination of ... (`Eliminate`)
  - They experienced a reduction in .. (They `reduced`)

- Strong VERBS deserve a life of their own. Why sap(erode, reduce, lower, lessen, wear away) their
  strength by turning them into NOUNS.

### 3. Staying Regular

- IRREGULAR VERBS
- Make sure you use the correct verb forms
- Pay special attention to IRREGULAR Verbs

### 4. He Don't Understand

- THE IRREGULAR VERB `TO DO`
- The most common error with the irregular verb `to do` occurs when making the first-person singular
  a contraction with `not`. (Do not/Does not)

- INCORRECT

  - Pudge `don't` know what to do with his money.
  - Spike `don't` remember his hometown very well.
  - Gertrude `don't` travel internationally.

- CORRECT
  - Pudge `doesn't` know what to do with his money.

  - Gertrude `doesn't` travel internationally.

### 5. They Had Went to My Office Earlier in the Day

- THE IRREGULAR VERB `TO GO`
- The irregular verb `to go` gives people problems most often in the present and past tenses.
  That is, they mistakenly, use `went` with the helping verb `has`, `have`, and `had`.

- INCORRECT

  - Fritz had `went` to the paris exhibit last year.
  - They had `went` to that conference earlier in the year.
  - I have `went` to the major power borkers to try to negotiate the deal.

- CORRECT

  - Fritz had `gone` to the paris exhibit last year.
  - They had `gone` to that conference earlier in the year.
  - I have `gone` to the major power borkers to try to negotiate the deal.

- MEMORY TIP
  - Remember that the classic movie is titled `Gone with the wind`, not `Went with the Wind`.

### 6. He Come Back From Overseas Early

- THE IRREGULAR VERB `TO COME`
- The most common error with the irregular verb `to come` occurs in the past tense.

- INCORRECT - Eldor `come` home from work early yesterday
- CORRECT - Eldor `came` home from work early yesterday
- MEMORY TIP
  - C`A`ME = P`A`ST
  - C`O`ME = N`O`W

### 7. I Seen Him Leave

- THE IRREGULAR VERB `TO SEE`
- The most common error with the irregular verb `to see` occurs in the past tense, with `seen`

- INCORRECT - We `seen` them go into the building.
- CORRECT - We `saw` them go into the building. / We have `seen` them go into the building.

### 8. Lie or Lay Before I Knock You Off Your Feet

- THE LIE/LAY LIMBO
- The most commong error with these two verbs pops up in sentences like these:

  - INCORRECT
    - Wilmo is going to `lay` down for a few minutes to rest.
    - That paperwork has been `laying` on my desks for days.
    - Her photo `laid` on my kitchen table for weeks before I could bear to put it away
  - CORRECT
    - Wilmo is going to `lie` down for a few minutes to rest.
    - That paperwork has been `lying` on my desks for days.
    - Her photo `lay` on my kitchen table for weeks before I could bear to put it away

- In these instances, somebody or something is `reclining`. The verb meaning `to recline` is `to lie`.
  (`To lie` also means `to tell a falsehood`, but nobody makes an error with that use)
- To lay means to place something. Once you place something, it then lies or reclines.

  - I `liad` the photo on my task yesterday; it has been `lying` there ever since.

- present ==> past ==> present participle ==> past participle
- lie ==> lied ==> lied ==> lied (To recline)
- lie ==> lay ==> lying ==> lain (To tell a falsehood)
- lay ==> laid ==> laid ==> laid (To place )

### 9. He Came, He Saw, He Conquered

- DON'T BE LAX ABOUT TENSE CHANGES
- Verbs have tense to reflect the time: PRESENT, PAST, FUTURE
- Don't chance Tenses carelessly without reason.
- INCORRECT
  - He e-mail included pricing; it also provides a volume-discount schedule
- CORRECT

  - He e-mail includees pricing; it also provides a volume-discount schedule

- MEMORY TIP
- Time is money. Be careful with your tenses as with your tens.

### 10. If I Was You

- WISHFUL THINKING AND THE SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD

- Subjenctive-Mood sentences State Conditions That Are Contrary to Fact or Highly Unlikely
  (They also express strong wishes, demands, or commands)

- Examples

  - If she `were` a billionaire, she `would` fund cancer research (She is not a billionaire)
  - If I `were` a CEO of that company, I `would` hire 200 more sales people next month (I am not the CEO)

- INCORRECT
  - If I `was` you, I would resign.
  - Pongo walked into the gym as if he `was` a Greek god.
- CORRECT

  - If I `were` you, I would resign.
  - Pongo walked into the gym as if he `were` a Greek god.

- In typical situations when the `if` part may actually be true, the verb following I or he/she remains `was`.
- Examples

  - If Fritz was told about the trouble in Atlanta, I guess he forgot it.(He may have been told)
  - If the caller was a client, Sarah must have not recognixed the name.
    (The caller may have been a client, but Sarah still didn't recognize the name)

- MEMORY TIP
  - When you hear phrases like "IF I WERE YOU, WHAT I WOULD DO IS...", you know that you are about to get ADVICE.

### 11. Pushy People Demanding Their Way

- THE SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD CONTINUED
- Subjenctive-mood verbs also express strong wishes, demands, concessions, and resolutions.
- The verbs follow in the minor clause after such words as

  - `command`, `demand`, `insist`, `order`, `recommend`, `require`, `wish`, `suggest`.

- INCORRECT

  - I wish she `was` able to transfer to headquarters.
  - Mortimer tiptoed through the trade show as though networking `was` a nasty business.

- INCORRECT

  - I wish she `were` able to transfer to headquarters.
  - Mortimer tiptoed through the trade show as though networking `were` a nasty business.

- Past Tense Subjenctive -

  - to be - `were`

- Present Tense Subjenctive

  - dropping the `s` from the third-person singular
  - to be - `be`
  - Example
    - They suggested that he `come` with them.
    - It was essential (that) he listen to me.
    - I prefer that he go alone.
  - In English, the present subjunctive functions independently of time. It is formed by taking
    the infinitive form of the verb and removing to.
  - Examples

    - Bruno asked that everyone `be` on time.
    - She had suggested that they `be` polite.

  - In essence these be construction sound similar to command forms (Imperative mood) of the verb.
    - Be careful, Be quiet, Be specific, Be thorough
  - If the switching to the word be sounds odd to you, consider the word should inserted (virtually) in front of it.
    - Executive demanded that Fritz should `write` the reports. (Should write)
    - Eldore insisted that Mortimer fire the team (should) `negotiate` the cruise fares (Should negotiate)
    - I insist that Fritz (should) `be` promoted. (Should be promoted)

- INCORRECT

  - The client requirement is that all consultants `are` financially literate.
  - He demands that the report `is` mailed rather than sent electronically.

- CORRECT

  - The client requirement is that all consultants `be` financially literate.
  - He demands that the report `be` mailed rather than sent electronically.

- NOTE: The subjunctive mood is found only in the minor (`subordinate clause`),
  never in the main clause of the sentence

- MEMORT TIP
  - `Subjunctive` sounds like `subjective`. Let the subjunctive mood remind you of subjective emotions:
    `demands`, `urges`, and `wishes`. Just as emotions frequently reverse peoples action, the subjunctive
    mood reverse the normal verb.

### 12. There's Problems With That!

- EXPLETIVE DELETED
- Expletive
  - an oath or swear word OR
  - a word or phrase used to fill out a sentence or a line of verse without adding to the sense.(There, it, that...)
- Basically, expletive constructions are phrases or sentences that begin
  with `There are`, `There is`, `It is`, `There were`, `There was`, or `It was`.
- These are also called `phantom subjects` - meaningless.
- Example

  - There were six people riding in our car. (INCORRECT/WEAK)
  - Six people were riding in our car. (CORRECT/STRONG)
  - It is a problem to suggest tax revolt. (INCORRECT/WEAK)
  - To suggest tax revolt is a problem. (CORRECT/STRONG)

- WEAK

  - There are whirling gizmos that attracted attention from every buyer.
  - There were some who negotiated fares better than 70 percent off retail price.
  - It is a big dissappointment to lose the game.
  - There are problems with retaining law firms over the internet.

- STRONGER

  - Whirling gizmos attracted attention from every buyer.
  - Some negotiated fares better than 70 percent off retail price.
  - Losing the game is big dissapointment.
  - Retaining law firms over the internet is problemetic.

- MEMORY TIP
  - These expletive words are comforting but meaningless.
  - Find the real subject, and select the verb accordingly.

### 13. "I WISH I MAY, I WISH I MIGHT" Tell Me Which Verb to Use Tonight?

- THE MAY/MIGHT DILEMMA
- MAY

  - `may` means that things are possilbe, even likely.

- MIGHT

  - `might` means that there is less likelihood of something happening.

- `may` implies `strong certainty about hypothetical events` and `might` expresses `a lesser degree of certainty`
- Examples

  - I may get to take an African safari. (Possible on my next trip to Africa)
  - I might get to take an African safari. (Not very likely, but I'm wishing and I'm hoping)
  - Percival may have to resign if he can't explain the errors. (Possible, even likely)
  - Percival might have to resign if he can't explain the errors. (Unlikely, teasing him)

- Now, let's add one more layer of complexity: `Might` is also the past tense of `may`.
- In those situation, the degree of complexity is the the criterion for using might.
  If the other verbs in the sentence are past tense, `may` becomes `might` (past tense)

- Examples

  - The report `stated` that the buyers `might` conduct plant tours unannounced.
  - Percival `said` he `might` resign.

- MEMORY TIP
  - `MAY` implies that things are more likely than `MIGHT` does.

### 14. "Sue is one Who..."

- THE ONE OF A KIND OR ONE OF A CATEGORY ARGUMENT

- Select the wrong verb in these sentences and you have changed the meaning dramatically.
  - Example (Vague meaning)
    - Trixy is one of the managers who `falsifies` time sheets.
    - Trixy is one of the managers who `falsify` time sheets.
- The dilemma is deciding which verb goes with the subject `who`. `who` is an indefinite pronoun, meaning that
  it can refer to either `Trixy` or `managers`. In such cases, flip the sentence around to reword it
  but retain the original meaning. Then the verb choise will become clear:

  - Example (Precise Meaning)
    - Of the managers, Trixy is one `falsifies` time sheets.
    - Of the managers `falsifying` time sheets, Trixy is one.

- Example (Vague meaning)

  - Wilmo lost one of his accounts that (`generate` or `generates`) hundreds of leads annually.

- Example (Precise meaning)

  - Of his accounts that `generate` hundreds of leads annually, Wilmo lost one.
  - Of his accounts Wilmo lost one that `generates` hundreds of leads annually,.

- MEMORY TIP
  - To find the right verb, flip the sentence, keeping the meaning intact.
  - The correct verb will rise to the occassion.

### 15. Separation Anxiery

- SUBJECTS AND VERBS THAT GET SPLIT APART

- Consider the sentence a long shoelace, with the subject on one end and the verb on the other.
  No matter how many eyelets you snake that shoelace through across your foot, at some point those two
  ends of the shoelace (the subject and the verb) must meet and tie together.

- Sometimes writers and talkers begin with the subject and then get sidetracked, tossing in other
  descriptive words and phrases before they finish their main point about the subject.

- These extra words that separate the subject and the verb confuse things. People choose the
  wrong verb form to match a word that's not the real subject.

- INCORRECT

  - `The secret` to hiring the best people as marketing and sales team members for small mom-and-pop
    organizations `are` finding people who have once been in business for themselves.
    (Members and organizations are not the SUBJECTS, they are OBJECTS of PREPOSTIONS)

- CORRECT

  - `The secret` to hiring the best people as marketing and sales team members for small mom-and-pop
    organizations `is` finding people who have once been in business for themselves.

- INCORRECT

  - After our analysis of the results of the customer satisfaction survey `was` several suggestions
    submitted by the boards of director.

- CORRECT

  - After our analysis of the results of the customer satisfaction survey `were` several suggestions
    submitted by the boards of director.

- You can catch this error quickly by cutting the flesh off the bone, leaving just the sentence skeleton;
  SUBJECT and VERB. Make the subject and verb match. Either SINGULAR or PLURAL

- MEMORY TIP
  - No matter where they fall, find the two ends of the shoelace (subject and verb) and tie them together.

### 16. Which End is Up?

- COMPLEMENTS OF THE VERB OR THE CHEF

Examples (All sentences are CORRECT)

- A good source of beta-carotene is carrots.
- Carrots are a good source of beta-carotene.
- Hunting and golfing apear to be his retirement goal.
- His retirement goal apprears to be hunting and golfing.
- Laptops are our hottest products for the season.
- Our hottest products for the season is the laptop.

### 17. Acting Alone or With Accomplices?

- VERBS AFTER COLLECTIVE NOUNS

- Collective Nouns - `jury`, `committee`, `management`, `team`, `audience`, `equipment`, `organization`
- In most situations, collective nouns act as a single unit, so they need a singular verb.
- INCORRECT

  - The `jury` `have` decided to give her probation rather than jail time.
  - Our `club` `are` donating its facilities as a homeless shelter during the emergency.
  - `Management` `are` disappointed in the sales volume for the year.
  - Our `Team` `have` met its deadline each quarter.
  - The `equipment` `need` servicing daily.
  - The `team` `argued` among itself about how to present the results.
  - The `committe` `have` spoken against one another to various reporters.

- CORRECT

  - The `jury` `has` decided to give her probation rather than jail time.
  - Our `club` `is` donating its facilities as a homeless shelter during the emergency.
  - `Management` `is` disappointed in the sales volume for the year.
  - Our `Team` `has` met its deadline each quarter.
  - The `equipment` `needs` servicing daily.
  - The `team` `argued` among itself about how to present the results.
  - The `team` members `argued` among itself about how to present the results.

  - The `committe` `has` spoken against one another to various reporters.
  - The `committe` members `have` spoken against one another to various reporters.

- Always treat Collection UNIT as a SINGLE ENTITY

### 18. None of your business

- DEFINITELY INDEFINITE PRONOUNS
- With INDEFINITE PRONOUNS, BE DEFINITE. Consider the context to determine the meaning, and then make the
  verb choice either singular or plural.

- INDEFINITE PRONOUNS

  - `none`, `most`, `all`, `one`, `some`, `more`, or `any`

- Verbs after the pronouns can be SINGULAR or PLURAL, depending on what noun or pronoun they replace
  or refer to in context. For

- Examples
  - Most of my `equipment` `is` under warranty.
  - Most of my `computers` `are` under warranty.
  - Some of my `money` `is` invested in mutual funds.
  - Some of my `retirement funds` `are` invested in annuities.
  - Some of the `bombs` `have` been set to detonate at noon.
  - Some of the `paint` `has` been leaking.
  - All of the `paperwork` `is` complete.
  - All of the `contracts` `are` complete.
  - None of the `building` `has` been damaged.
  - None of the `employees` `have` been complaining.
  - None of the `cars` `are` damaged.
  - None of the `coins` `are` missing.

### 19. Total'Em Up

- VERBS WITH TIME, MONEY, QUANTITIES, FRACTIONS AND PERCENTAGE
- The common mistake with expressions such as 20 dollars or 40 hours is to think them
  slipping through your hand or ticking one by one. While they do disappear fast, in most situations,
  consider these expressions to be one total amount.

- When thought of as a single unit, expression of time, money and quantity take a singular verb.
- Examples

  - `Twenty gallons` `is` all my gas tank holds.
  - `Forty hours` `is` now considered a short workweek for the typical company.
  - `Twenty-two percent` `represents` a small portion of the voting population.
  - `Six acres` `was` all that he inherited from his parents.

- MEMORY TIP
  - In math, you first learn to add numbers. In English, you do the same thing:
    One composite number (a total number of hours, dollars, miles, or whatever) expressed as a single total
    gets a singular verb.

### 20. The Kaleidoscope Effect

- `A` and `THE` before amounts
- Placing the article a or the in front of a noun that means a fraction or an amount that has
  the Kaleidoscope effect. These articles either expand or contract the meaning of the amounts that follow.

- Example

  - I want to talk to you about `a` number of things. (Means serveral things..)
  - `A` number of people attending the conference.(Many people)
  - `The` number of people attending the conference (Specific - only)
  - `A` number of people have called to complain (Many acting individually - PLURAL)
  - `The` number who asked to have their service disconnected is small.
    (One total referred to as a group - SINGULAR)

- MEMORY TIP
  - visualize the kaleidoscope effect of `a number` or `the number` as it `expands` or `limits`
    the meaning of your subject.

### 21. The Seasaw Effect

- EITHER/OR, NEITHER/NOR, NOT ONLY/BUT ALSO
- Consider both halves of `either/or`, `neither/nor`, and `not only/but also` subjects
  as if they are separate elements.

- RULES

  - Subjects linked by `either/or` and `neither/not` usually take a singular verb.
  - If one subject is `plural` and the other subject is `singular`, make the verb agree with
    the `closest subject`.

- EXAMPLES
  - Either your manager or your mentor `has` made a mistake
  - Either the salespeople in Atlanta or the salespeople in Los Angles `have` ....

## PART 2 - Pesky Pronouns: The Understudies

- Pronouns never have starring roles in sentences: Instead, they are stand-ins for nouns.

### 22. Just Between You and I

- The Case for Objective Pronouns

- ACTORS that can stand in for subjects

  - `I`, `you`, `he`, `she`, `it`, `we`, `they`, `who`, and `whoever`

- ACTORS that can stand in for objects

  - `me`, `you`, `him`, `her`, `it`, `us`, `them`, `whom`, and `whomever`

- You will notice that `you` and `it` can play either role - Subjects or Objects.
- Also, we have a whole slew of indefinite pronouns that can play both roles:

  - `anyone`, `everybody`, `none`, `some`, `all`, `many`, `one`, `them`, `these`, `those`, `this`, `that`,
    `what`, `any`, `each`, `both`, `nobody`, `few`, `others`, `several`

- INCORRECT

  - Just between you and `I`, we all know who runs this place.

- CORRECT

  - Just between you and `me`, we all know who runs this place. (Pronoun `I` can only accept SUBJECT Role)

- INCORRECT

  - Examples

    - Please call Ebeneezer and `I` with the test results.
      (Object of the verb - `me` has to be stand-in there)
    - He mailed multiple invoices to percipal, three clients, and `I`.
      (Object of the preposition - `me` has to be the stand-in here)

  - To Identify problems in the above, we could use a neat and quick TRICK.
    - Leave the other people out of a sentence and let your ear do the work.
    - The correct pronoun will become obvious.
    - You would NEVER SAY
      - `Please call I with the test results` (Omit other peoples - Ebeneezer )
      - `He mailed multiple invoices to I` (Omit other peoples - percipal, three clients)
    - You would SAY (Correct Form)
      - `Please call me with the test results`
      - `He mailed multiple invoices to me`

- CORRECT

  - Please call Ebeneezer and `me` with the test results.
  - He mailed multiple invoices to percipal, three clients, and m`e`.

- MEMORY TIP
  - Omit the other people in the sentences, and trust your ear to select the right objective pronoun.

### 23. Me and Pongo Know Him

- The Case for Nominative Pronouns
- BEING CONSIDERATE AND PUTTING OTHERS FIRST

- INCORRECT

  - Me and Eldora have a lunch appointment.
    - Going by the omission rule - `Me have a lunch appointment` - Does not SOUND right

- CORRECT

  - Eldora and I have a lunch appointment
    - Going by the omission rule - `I have a lunch appointment` - Does SOUND right

- Also, as we discussed BEING CONSIDERATE AND PUTTING OTHERS FIRST, we cannot say

  - `I and Eldora` have a lunch appointment (INCORRECT)
  - `Eldora and I` have a lunch appointment (CORRECT)

- MEMORY TIP
- To get the correct subject pronoun, test the sentence by dropping to other names, and let your ear do the rest.

### 24. Me, Myself, and I

- Reflexive Pronouns Flexing Their Muscles

- INCORRECT

  - Jordan and `myself` manage the department.
  - Heather, Tommy, and `myself` are involved in that meeting.
  - Why don't Frank, Sol, and `yourself` accompany Melinda to Atlanta?

- Whatever happened to plain old me? A sentence must contain another NOUN or PRONOUN to which the `self` refers.
- If `I` is not already in the sentence, it is INCORRECT to add `myself`.
- If `Susan` is not already mentioned in the sentence, then it's INCORRECT to stuff `herself` in there.
- If `Greg` is not already mentioned in the sentence, then it's INCORRECT to stuff `himself` in there.

- Again, leave out the other people and let your ear do the work.
- You would never say `Myself` is involved in the meeting.
- Neither would you say, `Why don't `yourself` accompany Melinda to Atlantia?

- CORRECT

  - Jordan and `I` manage the department.
  - Heather, Tommy, and `I` are involved in that meeting.
  - Why don't Frank, Sol, and `I` accompany Melinda to Atlanta?

- A good reason, on the other hand, to toss in a self pronoun is to add emphasis. consider it a raised
  voice: `I myself told him about the problem!`

- MEMORY TIP
  - Have you ever heard the line, `I am so busy that I'm meeting myslef coming and going?`.
  - That is the correct usuage refers to the I that's already in the sentence.

### 25. To Whom It May Concern

- WHO versus WHOM

### 26. She's Taller Than Me

- Pronouns After Than

- We order supplies from Contintental more often than `them`. (we order from them).
- We order supplies from Contintental more often than `they`. (order from Contintental)

- Ziggy knows more about politics than `me`. (she knows about me)
- Ziggy knows more about politics than `I`. (know)

- She tabulates more cals than `we`. (do)
- She tabulates more cals than `us`. (she tabulate us)

- CORRECT COMBINATION

  - We order supplies from Contintental more often than `they`(order).
  - Ziggy knows more about politics than `I`. (know)
  - She tabulates more cals than `we`. (do)

- If in doubt about this particular construction, go ahead and say the missing word or two aloud either
  after or before the `than`, and the correct pronoun will become apparent.

- MEMORY TIP
  - Repeat this Ryhme: Before or After `than`, understand that there is a span of missing words.

### 27. You Know What They Always Say About That

- Unclear References

- Ensure reference of these nouns in sentences

  - `this`, `that`, `they`, `these`, `those`, `it`

- Always back trace the referenced pronouns. They should not be vague or unclear.
- MEMORY TIP
  - You know what they always say.
    - Consider that common phrase a reminder that people are asking the same thing about your communication:
      - Who are `they`? What's the `it`, What's the `which`?

### 28. Which Hunts

- THAT versus WHICH

- Which of the following two sentences is correct?

  - People do not buy products `which` seem overpriced and shabbily packaged.
  - People do not buy products `that` seem overpriced and shabbily packaged.

- The distinctiction between these two is not difficult if you keep this one simple test in mind:

  - Does the key point of the sentence change if you remove `that` or `which` clause?

- FOLLOW THE BELOW RULE:

  - If you can REMOVE the clause in question and not change the meaning of the sentence,
    use a `comma` and `which` to set off from the reset of the sentence.
  - If you cannot, use `that` without a comma.

- So taking the example give above, if we remove the clause "`which` seem overpriced and shabbily packaged."
  and read the sentence "People do not buy products" - Does this make sense? It definitely NOT, hence
  the `that` clause is essential to its meaning. So the second sentence is the correct one of the two.

  - People do not buy products `that` seem overpriced and shabbily packaged.

- OTHER EXAMPLES

  - Ebeneezer submitted his sales reports, which was late as usual.
    (Just added information - you can omit the `which` clause and not lose the gist of the sentences)
  - Mortimer parked his car in front of the building that faces Street.
    (You cannot omit `that` here as it is adding an essential information)

- MEMORY TIP
  - Think of `which` clauses as switch clauses. The `which` signals the reader that you're switching off track
    briefly to provide additional `nonessential information`. Use a `comma` to set off this side note.

### 29. Is Shamu a Who?

- People WHO or THAT?

- People typically prefer to be called by their names. And when names are unavailable, they at least
  like to feel human as oppposed to inanimate. That is the issue with `who` and `that`

- When referring to people (and animals treated as people, such as Sham, the whales, and Fluffy, the kitten)
  use `who` or `that`.

- When refering to places, ideas, or things, use `that`, `which` or `it` NOT who.

- MEMORY TIP
  - People Rule. That means they have choices: `that` or `who`.
  - Inanimate objects have to take the leftovers.

## PART 3 - Modifier Mishaps

- Sentences may start out simple. But then their meanings become MODIFIED by added words.
- EXAMPLES

  - Rufus walked toward the lake.
  - Rufus walked slowly toward the lake.
  - Rufus walked very slowly toward the lake.
  - Alone, Rufus walked very slowly toward the lake.
  - Alone and dejected, Rufus walked very slowly toward the lake.
  - Alone and dejected, Rufus walked very slowly toward the lake that rippled gently against the muddy bank.
  - Alone and dejected - as if he'd lost his best friend - Rufus walked very slowly toward the lake
    that rippled gently against the muddy bank.

- A `modifier` is the term we give to words, phrases, or clauses that `attach to` or describe something,
  changing (expanding or limiting) its meaning.
- But as with software modifications, sometimes the modifiers added to the sentences cause problems.

### 30. Misplaced Modifiers That Mystify

- Putting Them in Their Place

- When modifiers land in the spot closest to what they describe the sentence informs and clarifies.
- When modifiers land out of place, the sentence can confuse or amuse readers.

- EXAMPLES

  - INCORRECT - `At the age of 100`, `Kilpatrick` has been begging his dad to give up driving the car.
    (The situation has to be public safety hazard. If Kilpatrick is 100, his dad certainly has to be approaching
    120, with failing eyesight and slow reflexes)
  - CORRECT - Kilpatrick has been begging `his dad`, `at the age of 100`, to give up driving his car.

  - INCORRECT - `Injected directly into the lips`, `the doctor` can strengthen the facial muscles with his medication.
    (The doctor was injected into the lips? A close bedside manner, don't you think)
  - CORRECT - `Injected directly into the lips`, `his medication` can strengthen the facial muscles.

  - INCORRECT - `Mislabeled and misfiled`, `the executives` had not read the report.
    (Were the executives mislabeled and misfiled)
  - CORRECT - The executives had not read `the mislabeled and misfiled` `report`.

  - INCORRECT - Harrison attended the meeting, where he planned to announce `the merger` `with misgivings`.
    (Did the merger have misgivings)
  - CORRECT - `With misgivings`, `Harison` attended the meeting, where he planned to announce the merger.

- Misplaced adverbs are common culprits. They got dropped in before the verb when they should go after it - or after
  when they should go before it. Moving one word around can make a big difference. The single-word adverb modifiers
  most frequently misplaced are these - `almost`, `only`, `definitely`, `often`, and `completely`

- EXAMPLES

  - Trixy `ONLY` `leased this car` for her company's sales team. (She only leased the car - she didn't buy it.)
  - Trixy leased `ONLY` `this car` for her company's sales team. (She leased only one car.)
  - Trixy leased this car `ONLY` `for her company's sales team`. (Only the sales team can use it)
  - Trixy leased this car for her `ONLY` `company's sales team`. (She has only one company)
  - Trixy leased this car for her company's `ONLY` `sales team`. (That sales team had better be good - as its only team that has car)

- MY POINT

  - Slide the adverb around, and double-check your meaning.
  - EXAMPLES
    - This suit ONLY costs $368 today.
    - This suit costs ONLY $368 today.

- MEMORY TIP
  - Modifiers can be mystify. Remember to them in their place!

### 31. Can You Hook Me Up?

- Dangling Modifiers

- There is often the problem with danglers. The writer thinks the meaning is obvious; to the reader; it is not.
- Such words or phrases dangle because they aren't attached to anything.
- With MISPLACED MODIFIERS, at least the words they describe are somewhere in the sentence.
- But DANGLERS don't attach to anything but a mysterious thought in the speaker's or writer's mind.

- More often than not, danglers are verb forms ending in `-ing`, or `-ed` (Technically called Participles)
  They may dangle at the begining or end of a sentence.

- INCORRECT - `Walking the dog in the quiet before dawn`, `my cell phone` startled me.
  (Cell phone do have new features today, but I haven't seen the `walking the dog` option on mine yet)
- INCORRECT - `Having received approval on the deal earlier in the week`, `the documents` were ready to be signed.
  (Who received the approval? Where did this wheeler-dealer go? He is not in the sentence anymore.)

- Such sentence jump off the page - When someone else writes them. But they are not easy to spot in your own writing.
  The trick to catching them is diligence in looking for those descriptors ending in `-ing` and `-ed`

- INCORRECT - `Downgrade to category 3 hurricane`, `Eldora` decided to go see her parents over the weekend about her anger over the money.
  (I am littler confused here. Is Eldora being referred t o as a hurricane because of her temper)
- CORRECT - `With the hurricane donwgraded to category 3`, `Eldora` decided to go see her parents over the weekend.

- INCORRECT - The house should be put on the market immediately, considering my cash-flow situation.
  (Who is considering the cash-flow situation? The homeowner? The mortgage holder? His creditors?
  Althought this dangler comes at the end of the sentence, the reader still doesn't know who's considering.)
- CORRECT - Considering my cash-flow situation, I have decided to put my house on the market immediately.

- To correct DANGLERS in procedure, write directly to the person following the instructions.

- INCORRECT - When applying pressure, the tube should be upright.
  (Is the tube going to apply pressure? Probably, a person will)
- CORRECT - Whe applying the pressure, you should place the tube upright.
- CORRECT - Whe applying pressure, you place the tube upright.

- INCORRECT - Using the new code, files should be named by date.
  (The files probably aren't going to use the codes)
- CORRECT - Using the new code, you name the files by date
- CORRECT - Using the new code, (you) name the files by date

- ABSOLUTES (Phrases that DON'T Dangle)

  - These common phrases don't dangle.
  - Some common sentence starters seem to dangle - but don't. That is they don't dangle in the sense we talked above.
  - The grammatical terms for those is ABSOLUTES; They have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the sentence.
  - Commonly used to introduce a thought, they have become simply manners of speech.
  - Examples

    - `Generally speaking`, international travel is still quite safe on that airline.
    - `Granted`, the weather is unpredictable this time of year.

  - PHRASES EXAMPLES
    - `Generally Speaking`, `Granted`, `To be sure`, `Alternatively`, `By and large`, `Barring unforseen circumstances`
    - `When all is said and done`, `Contrary to popular belief`, `To tell the truth`, `to be perfectly honest`
    - `To be perfectly clear`, `Strictly speaking`, `in the final analysis`, `in the long run`, `on the whole`

- MEMORY TIP
  - Visualize a sentence with begining and ending with a descriptive phrase.

### 32. "...Which Is What I Always Say..."

- Dangling Whichs
- Blame this common error on multitasking. People have so many things going on when they start a sentence on one topic
  and finish it on totally different terrain.

- EXAMPLE

  - I just finished a pile of evaluations. So glad to has those off my desk, `which` reminds me that I am supposed
    to call Amber and tell her that I can't keep our lunch date because I have a client conference call during the noon hour.
    (What is WHICH? - did the desk remind him?)

- `WHICH` has to be substituted for a specific NOUN in the sentence. It cannot refer to a general
  concept behind hidden in the reader's mind.

- Example

  - I was planning to drive to Denver to visit my family last weekend, `which` is always a riot because
    you will never know what will happen. (`Which` is always a riot - `Denver`? `The family`? `Weekends`?)

- MEMORY TIP
  - `Which` must stand for something, or readers will mistake them for everything.
  - Always ensure to use `Specifi Noun` instead of generic `WHICH` to avoid the confusion.

### 33. Troublesome Twosomes

- One Word or Two?

- Confusing word pairs
  - `a lot` / `alot`
  - `all right` / `allright`
  - `all together` / `alltogether`
  - `all ready` / `already`
  - `any more` / `anymore`
  - `any one` / `anyone`
  - `any more`/ `anymore`
  - `any way` / `anyway`
  - `every day` / `everyday`
  - `every one` / `everyone`
  - `may be` / `maybe`
  - `some time` / `sometime`

### 34. Learn This Backwards and Forewards

- The Unnecessary - S

- Save the extra -s on these directions.
- INCORRECT - `backwards`, `towards`, `anyways` `anywheres`
- CORRECT - `backward`, `toward`, `anyway`, `anywhere`

EXAMPLES

- INCORRECT
  - The supervisor stepped `backwards` and fell from the platform.
  - My boss believes that winning this contract does not matter `anyways` in the long-term relationship with this client.
- CORRECT

  - The supervisor stepped `backward` and fell from the platform.
  - My boss believes that winning this contract does not matter `anyway` in the long-term relationship with this client.

- MEMORY TIP
  - The world has become too crowded for the extraneous - like extra - `s's`

### 35. A Honor or an Honor to Be Here?

- The ARTICLES - `A` or `AN`
- Articles of Incorporation. Articles of Agreement. Articles of Faith.
- Articles POINT out nouns using - `the`, `a`, `an`

- `a` - Use `a` before words that begin with a consonant.
- `an` - Use `an` before words that begin with a vowel or vowel sound.

- Examples
  - Dilbert hired `a` turkey for an assistant.
  - Wilmo considers it `an` honor to speak to an artisan of your clibar.
    (The `h` is silent, so the word begins with a VOWEL Sound, hence `an` is used)

## PART 4 - ADJECTIVE and ADVERB ATTITUDES

- ADJECTIVES tell more about NOUNS and PRONOUNS. These describing words limit or expand the meaning of the nouns or
  pronouns they sorround

  - EXAMPLES
    - The `late` `march` report.
    - Those `ugly`, `torn` chairs in the lobby.
    - That `bulk-volume` contract signed last week.
    - His `manipulative` manager working in the back office.

- ADVERBS tell more about VERBS, ADVERBS, ADJECTIVES, and sometimes the whole sentence.
  - EXAMPLES
    - He resigned `quickly` after they discovered the fraud.
    - The competition is so `much` stronger that it was last season.
    - He found it `very` difficult to do a good job.
    - `Frankly`, I don't care who wins the contract.

### 36. She Did Things Differently

- Adjectives Modifying Verbs - A No-No
- ADVERBS tell more about VERBS, ADVERBS, ADJECTIVES, and sometimes the whole sentence
- ADJECTIVES tell more about NOUNS and PRONOUNS

- The common mix-ups happen when ADJECTIVES collide with VERBS. That is, people mistakenly use the ADJECTIVE form
  of a word (leave off the `-ly`) when they need an adverb.

- INCORRECT

  - The product `sells` `quick` when the price is right.
  - The manager `spoke` real `candid` about his ambitions for the future.
  - Dilbert `organized` the proposal `brilliant` for his competitive situation.
  - He `restructured` the department `careful` so as not to upset people.
  - He `invested` his money `cautious`.

- CORRECT

  - The product `sells` `quickly` when the price is right.
  - The manager `spoke` real `candidly` about his ambitions for the future.
  - Dilbert `organized` the proposal `brilliantly` for his competitive situation.
  - He `restructured` the department `carefully` so as not to upset people.
  - He `invested` his money `cautiously`.

- More Examples

  - The manager is `candid`, but he speaks `candidly`.
  - The proposal may be `brilliant`, but it's organized `brillaintly`.
  - Pongo may have been `careful`, but he restructured `carefully`.

- The difference comes down to what you are describing - the PERSON/THINGS (use Adjective) or the ACTION (use Adverb)
- Add `-ly` on descriptors telling more about the VERB, and you will solve 95 percent of the adverb errors.

- EXAMPLES (VERBS + ADVERB Combinations)

  - Run Quickly, Approve knowingly, Engaged single-handedly, Negotiated confidently, Judged fairly
  - Reported objectively, Chatted aimlessly, Pushed relentlessly, Managed faithfully
  - Fired fearlessly, Hired enthusiastically, Scored triumphantly

- MEMORY TIP
  - If the descriptor refers to the action (VERB) rather than the PERSON/THING, add the `-ly`.

### 37. The Team played Real Good

- Well versus Good

- The Team might have played `well`, but it did not play `good`.

- `Good` describes something or somebody (Like other ADJECTIVES, good can be used
  to describe only NOUNS or PRONOUNS - People, Place, Things, or Ideas)

  - EXAMPLE
    - Sarah is a `good` manager.
    - Florida is a `good` location for our waterhouse.
    - Those engineers made a `good` decision in drilling the oil.
    - Freedom from pricing restrictions is a `good` idea.

- `Well` tells how something is DONE/PERFORMED

  - Examples
    - Dilbert writes `well`.
    - The engineering team planned `well`.
    - The machines run `well`.
    - The car drives `well` in most road conditions.

- In any given situations, ask yourself: Am I talking about a THING, PERSON, PLACE or IDEA? - use `good`
- OR I am talking about how somebody or something PERFORMED? if so, use `well`

- The frames make you look `good`; we make you look `well` (CORRECT) - Deep meaning :D
  - Means - The frames make you as a person look beautiful and handsome. Our Optometrists make you see well.

### 38. This Job Is More Simpler Than What I Had Before

- Comparing With More and Most

- You sister is `brighter`, `faster`, and `more conscientious`?

  - Ever wondered why `brighter` not `more brighter` OR why `more conscientious` not `conscientiouser`

- When using a `ONE-Syllable` word to compare things or people, you typically add `-er`, or `-est`

  - EXAMPLES
    - `quick`, `quicker`, `quickest`
    - `sharp`, `sharper`, `sharpest`
    - `limp`, `limper`, `limpest`
    - `light`, `lighter`, `lightest`

- When using Longer Adjectives (`Words of two or more syllables`) to compare things or pople
  you typically need the help of `more` or `less`.

  - EXAMPLES
    - `more` brilliant, `most` brilliant
    - `more` confusing, `most` confusing
    - `less` memorable, `least` memorable
    - `less` understandable, `least` understandable

- Some adjectives used to compare people or things are totally dufferent words altogether.

  - EXAMPLES
    - `good`, `better`, `best`

- MEMORY TIP
  - If the Adjective has only ONE SYLLABLE, add one syllabl to compare (`-er`, `-est`).
  - If the Adjective already has two or more syllables, leave it alone.
    Instead, add a word to compare(more or most; less or least)

### 39. It Is The Most Unique Gift I've Ever Received!

- Unique, Round, Sorrounded, Square, Perfect - or Not?
- Either something is unique or it is not
- Either something is roung or it is not
- Either something is squashed, deflated, oval or some other oddity - but not round.
- Either something is square - or not
- THERE IS NO STATE IN BETWEEN.

- To insist that something is more unique, more perfect, almost sorrounder or the most square of the groups
  shows a misunderstanding of the original word.

- MEMORY TIP
  - Think in terms of black or white, not shades of gray.
  - With the words round, square, flat, unique, perfect, and sorrounded,
    consider the old song lyrics - `There is no Mr. In-Between`

### 40. This Checkout - 20 Items or Less

- Less Versus Fewer

- LESS / MORE (Uncoutable Singulars)

  - `less` time, `less` inclination, `less` willpower, `less` stress
  - `more` peace

- FEWER (Countble Plurals)

  - `fewer` opportunities, `fewer` workers, `fewer` employers, `fewer` hours

- MEMORY TIP
  - If you can count it, use `fewer`.
  - If you cannot count it, use `less`

### 41. He Has Over a Millon Miles on That Airline.

- Over Versus More Than

- Confusion between `over` and `more than`
- `Over` - It refers to a physical position
- `more than` - It applies to amounts.
- Both of these words (`over` and `more than`) are synonyms but not interchangeable.

- INCORRECT - Gertrude has `over` 10 years of Military Experience
- CORRECT - Gertrude has `more than` 10 years of Military Experience

- CORRECT

  - Elbeneezer has `more than` 10 million excuses for why he can't get his reports finished on time.
  - Mortimer went `over` his boss's head to ask for a raise.
  - Fritz looked `over` the bluprints and explained the changes.
  - Wilmo has `more than` four different supervisors who rate his work.
  - Eldora wants to be paid double time for `more than` 40 hours.

- MEMORY TIPS
  - When you are talking about NUMBERS, the correct phrase is `higher`, `more than` NOT `over`
    (unless, of course, you are talking about fences)

### 42. I Like Smaller Cars

- Incomplete Comparisons

- INCORRECT - Daffy likes the Midwest better. (Better than which Area?)
- CORRECT - Daffy likes the Midwest better than the South.

- INCORRECT - This is a longer report (Longer than what? longer than someone else send/wrote?)
- CORRECT - This report is longer than what I expected.

- INCORRECT - May's sales are higher than April.(Really? Is May and April are Girls?)
- CORRECT - Sales in May are higher than the sales were in April.

  someone who seems more dependable and trustworthy. (Than who?)
- CORRECT - Few months, I have been interviewing general contractors about a new office building, and I have finally found
  someone who seems more dependable and trustworthy than the contractor who built my last office complex.

- INCORRECT - Mortimer saw Eldora give a presentation last week; he said she had much more confidence (Than what or who?)
- CORRECT - Mortimer saw Eldora give a presentation last week; he said she had much more confidence than previously.

- INCORRECT - Fourth-quarter sales are higher than the third-quarter.
- CORRECT - Fourth-quarter sales are higher than the third-quarter sales.

- MEMORY TIP
- Imagine the listener or reader raising an eyebrow and asking:
  - As compared to what? As compared to who? As compared to when?

## PART 5 - PARALLEL BARS AND BALANCE BEAMS

- Parallelism is the grammatical term given to that matching concept.

### 43. To Balance or Not to Balance - That is the Question

- Parallelism Perfected
- Equal Ideas deserve similar structure and expression

- INCORRECT - You can either `pay now` or `you can pay later` (Either/or should link ideas together in a same way)
- CORRECRT - You can eitehr `pay now` or `pay later`

- INCORRECT - He doesn't know whether `renting more office spare` or `try to hire a virtual sales team` would be better approach.
- CORRECT - He doesn't know whether `renting more office spare` or `trying to hire a virtual sales team` would be better approach.

- MEMORY TIP
  - PARA...LLEL sounds like PAIR. A pair of ideas should be EXPRESSED (Or dressed) as twins

### 44. I Worked, Waiter, and Was Rewarded

- Parallelism With a Viewpoint Change
- Politicians can change their viewpoints on issues from decade to decade, or even day to day, for that matter. But you CANNOT.

- FIRST PERSON - `I`, `We`, `our`, `my`
- SECOND PERSON - `you`
- THIRD PERSON - `he`, `she`, `they`, `clients`

- INCORRECT
  - Taxes on `small businesses` passed from parents to their children have become outragous, and `you` shouldn't
    have to pay them. (Do you see the problem here? The writer stars out talking about small businesses in `general`
    and then switches in mid-sentence to talk to `you` the readers, directly)
    - `Third-Person Viewpoint` to `Second-Person Viewpoint`
- CORRECT (Either use Third Person OR Second Person - Make sure you are consistent)

  - Taxes on `small businesses` passed from parents to their children have become outragous, and `business owners`
    shouldn't have to pay them.
  - `Your` Taxes on a small businesses passed from parents to their children have become outragous, and `you` shouldn't
    have to pay them.

- EXAMPLES

  - INCORRECT
    - All vendors should e-mail their invoices, and please attach copies of the work orders.
  - CORRECT

    - Please e-mail your invoices, and attach copies of the work orders.
    - All vendors should e-mail their invoices, and attach copies of the work orders.

  - INCORRECT
    - The clinic will see patients beginning at 02:00; you will also beed to bring proof of insurance.
  - CORRECT

    - The clinic will see patients beginning at 02:00; the clinic staff will also need to see patients proof of insurance coverage.
    - You can schedule your appointment at the clinic or drop by after it opends at 02:00. You will also need to bring proof
      of insurance coverage

  - INCORRECT
    - You must schedule weekly staff meetings, and managers also need to participate in regional meetings during the last
      week of each month.
  - CORRECT
    - Manager must schedule weekely staff meetings, and they'll need to participate in regional meetings during the last week
      of each month.
    - You must schedule weekly staff meetings and participate in regional meetings during the last week of each month.

### 45. Verbs with Attitude

- Active and Passive Voice
- Active Voice verbs generally make writing crisp, clear, and concise.
- Passive Voice verbs also have a place or purpose: they add variety, slow the pace, and focus on the results and  
  action of the sentence if the DOER is unimportant.

- The Grammar goof happens when the two (both active and passive verbs) are mixed in one sentence or worse, within one clause,
  creating insonsistency and confusion about who is doing what. so DON'T EVER MIX BOTH in ONE SENTENCE.

- EXAMPLES

  - INCORRECT - You need to sign these checks (active), and the social security number should be written on them (passive).
  - CORRECT - You need to sign these checks (active), and write your social security number on them (active).

  - INCORRECT
    - Phone will be installed in every office (passive), and they will repaint walls(active). (Phone will repaint the walls?)
  - CORRECT
    - Phone will be installed in every office (passive), and the walls will be repainted (passive)
    - The night crew will install the phones in every office (active), and repaint the walls (active)

- MEMORY TIP
  - Use ACTIVE or PASSIVE verbs consistently witing a sentence. And as a rule of thumb, put people in your
    prose (active voice) for clear, concise writing.

### 46. Time Marches On - But at the Same Pace

- Don't be lax About Tense Changes
- If you are taking about the `PRESENT` time frame, keep all the verbs in the `PRESENT TENSE`.
- If you are taking about something that happened in the `PAST`, keep all the verbs in the `PAST TENSE`.

- If you are talking about different time periods, by all means, you will need to switch tenses.

- MEMORY TIP
  - If you have reason to change tenses, do it. If not, don't.

## PART 6: PUNCTUATION PROBLEMS

### 47. Comma Hiccups

- Unnecessary Commas

- 1. Between Descriptive word and the noun it describes

  - INCORRECT - She bought a few run-down, inexpensive, house to remodel.
  - CORRECT - She bought a few run-down, inexpensive house to remodel.

- 2. Between a Subject and a Verb

  - INCORRECT - Growing the company through acquisitions, has been a challange.
  - CORRECT - Growing the company through acquisitions has been a challange.

- 3. Between Two Phrases joined by a Conjunction

  - INCORRECT - Bruno was hired in August, but was fired almost immediately.
  - CORRECT - Bruno was hired in August but was fired almost immediately.
  - CORRECT - Bruno was hired in August, but he was fired almost immediately.

- MEMORY TIP
  - If you can't give a specific reason for a COMMA, don't cause a hiccup in the flow of thoughts.

### 48. Comma Clauses and Pauses

- Essential and Nonessential - That is the Question

- A comma tells a reader to PAUSE. The Absense of comma means that a reader should keep going full speed ahead.

  - If you SET OFF the middle or final part of a sentence with a COMMA, you are telling a reader that part
    is NONESSENTIAL - that it adds information but is not essential to the meaning of the sentence.
  - If you CANNOT remove the part of the sentence without changing the meaning of what's LEFT, then don't
    set that part OFF with commas.ß

- EXAMPLES

  - I know the man `who` bought my car (Essential: the `who` clause tells which man - NO COMMA)
  - Daffy signed the contract, `which` the client mailed overnight. (Nonessential: the `which` clause just adds information
    about the contract but doesn't distinguish this contract from another - COMMA to set off)

- HERE is the RULE of THUMB for those ESSENTIAL and NONESSENTIAL clauses that involves `THAT` and `WHICH`
  - `Which` clauses give `nonessential` information. `Use commas to set them off`.
  - `That` clauses provide `essential` information. `Don't use Comma`.

### 49. "Hi Hank, What Do You Think Frank?"

- Commas When Addressing People Directly

- Examples

  - Hi Hank,
  - Dear Fritz,
  - Hey Spike, are you coming today?
  - Trixy, is it you in the picture?

- When you are talking to someone, you have to get that person's attention:

  - Set off the name with Commas so that the reader PAUSES before and after, and takes notice that
    you are speaking directly to him or her.

  - When you Talk to people, Punctuate (Take a Pause in SPEAKING, and Add a COMMA in Writing) so that they will Listen.

- MEMORY TIP
  - When talking to people directly, add the comma, add figuratively pause until they look you in the eye.

### 50. Dear Spike

- Punctuation After Saluations
- A semicolon(;) never follows a saluation.
- The use of COMMAS(,) or COLONS(:) in greetings is a matter of formality or familiarity.

- The following greetings are arranged from VERY FORMAL to VERY INFORMAL

  - Dear Mr. Raymer:
  - Dear Mr. Raymer,
  - Dear Spike:
  - Dear Spike,
  - Spike,
  - Spike - (very informal)

- MEMORY TIP
  - Using a Semicolon(;) to punctuate a saluation is as inappropriate as eating with a toothbrush. It is the wrong TOOL.

### 51. She needs no Introduction

- Commas to Introduce

- Generally Speaking, use a COMMA after below to help readers quickly skim to the major idea of the sentence.

  - INTRODUCTORY WORDS
  - PHRASES
  - CLAUSES

- EXAMPLES
  - Honestly, I am pleased with this product.
  - Disappointed by the results on the job, he resigned.
  - Before you leave, please explain the pricing options.
  - Having header the ad during the Super Bowl, the were prepared for the competitive reaction.
  - In the first few months of the product launch, the sales people seem more highly motivated to call
    on inactive accounts than they do later in the campaign.

### 52. Punctuation Powerless

- RUN-ONS - Semicolons Slip-Sliding Away

### 53. One Car, Two Cars, Three Cars, Four

- Commas to Separate Equal Things

### 54. The Alpha and the Omega

- Enclosing Commas Come in Paris

### 55. Colon Scope - Here's the scope

- Colons Before a List

### 56. Fragmented Thoughts

- Unintentional Fragments

### 57. Would You Send Me Your Address Please

- Indirect Questions and Softened Commands

### 58. Can You Hear Me Now?

- Indirect Quotations

### 59. Inside or Outside?

- Where, Oh Where, Do the Quotation Marks Go?

### 60. Ripley's Believe It or Not

- Quotation Marks to Change the Tone or the Meaning

### 61. Spare Tires

- Single Quotation Marks
