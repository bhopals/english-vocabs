### 3. Staying Regular

  That is, they mistakenly, use `went` with the helping verb `has`, `have`, and `had`.

- INCORRECT

- INCORRECT - Eldor `come` home from work early yesterday
- CORRECT - Eldor `came` home from work early yesterday
- MEMORY TIP

### 7. I Seen Him Leave

- THE IRREGULAR VERB `TO SEE`
- The most common error with the irregular verb `to see` occurs in the past tense, with `seen`

- INCORRECT - We `seen` them go into the building.
- CORRECT - We `saw` them go into the building. / We have `seen` them go into the building.

### 8. Lie or Lay Before I Knock You Off Your Feet

- THE LIE/LAY LIMBO
- The most commong error with these two verbs pops up in sentences like these:

  - INCORRECT
    - Wilmo is going to `lay` down for a few minutes to rest.
    - That paperwork has been `laying` on my desks for days.
    - Her photo `laid` on my kitchen table for weeks before I could bear to put it away
  - CORRECT
    - Wilmo is going to `lie` down for a few minutes to rest.
    - That paperwork has been `lying` on my desks for days.
    - Her photo `lay` on my kitchen table for weeks before I could bear to put it away

- In these instances, somebody or something is `reclining`. The verb meaning `to recline` is `to lie`.
  (`To lie` also means `to tell a falsehood`, but nobody makes an error with that use)
- To lay means to place something. Once you place something, it then lies or reclines.

  - I `liad` the photo on my task yesterday; it has been `lying` there ever since.

- present ==> past ==> present participle ==> past participle
- lie ==> lied ==> lied ==> lied (To recline)
- lie ==> lay ==> lying ==> lain (To tell a falsehood)
- lay ==> laid ==> laid ==> laid (To place )

### 9. He Came, He Saw, He Conquered

### 10. If I Was You

- WISHFUL THINKING AND THE SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD

- Subjenctive-Mood sentences State Conditions That Are Contrary to Fact or Highly Unlikely
  (They also express strong wishes, demands, or commands)

- Examples

  - If she `were` a billionaire, she `would` fund cancer research (She is not a billionaire)
  - If I `were` a CEO of that company, I `would` hire 200 more sales people next month (I am not the CEO)

- INCORRECT
  - If I `was` you, I would resign.
  - Pongo walked into the gym as if he `was` a Greek god.
- CORRECT

  - If I `were` you, I would resign.
  - Pongo walked into the gym as if he `were` a Greek god.

- In typical situations when the `if` part may actually be true, the verb following I or he/she remains `was`.
- Examples

  - If Fritz was told about the trouble in Atlanta, I guess he forgot it.(He may have been told)
  - If the caller was a client, Sarah must have not recognixed the name.
    (The caller may have been a client, but Sarah still didn't recognize the name)

- MEMORY TIP
  - When you hear phrases like "IF I WERE YOU, WHAT I WOULD DO IS...", you know that you are about to get ADVICE.

### 11. Pushy People Demanding Their Way

- THE SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD CONTINUED
- Subjenctive-mood verbs also express strong wishes, demands, concessions, and resolutions.
- The verbs follow in the minor clause after such words as

  - `command`, `demand`, `insist`, `order`, `recommend`, `require`, `wish`, `suggest`.

- INCORRECT

  - I wish she `was` able to transfer to headquarters.
  - Mortimer tiptoed through the trade show as though networking `was` a nasty business.

- INCORRECT

  - I wish she `were` able to transfer to headquarters.
  - Mortimer tiptoed through the trade show as though networking `were` a nasty business.

- Past Tense Subjenctive -

  - to be - `were`

- Present Tense Subjenctive

  - dropping the `s` from the third-person singular
  - to be - `be`
  - Example
    - They suggested that he `come` with them.
    - It was essential (that) he listen to me.
    - I prefer that he go alone.
  - In English, the present subjunctive functions independently of time. It is formed by taking
    the infinitive form of the verb and removing to.
  - Examples

    - Bruno asked that everyone `be` on time.
    - She had suggested that they `be` polite.

  - In essence these be construction sound similar to command forms (Imperative mood) of the verb.
    - Be careful, Be quiet, Be specific, Be thorough
  - If the switching to the word be sounds odd to you, consider the word should inserted (virtually) in front of it.
    - Executive demanded that Fritz should `write` the reports. (Should write)
    - Eldore insisted that Mortimer fire the team (should) `negotiate` the cruise fares (Should negotiate)
    - I insist that Fritz (should) `be` promoted. (Should be promoted)

- INCORRECT

  - The client requirement is that all consultants `are` financially literate.
  - He demands that the report `is` mailed rather than sent electronically.

- CORRECT

  - The client requirement is that all consultants `be` financially literate.
  - He demands that the report `be` mailed rather than sent electronically.

- NOTE: The subjunctive mood is found only in the minor (`subordinate clause`),
  never in the main clause of the sentence

- MEMORT TIP
  - `Subjunctive` sounds like `subjective`. Let the subjunctive mood remind you of subjective emotions:
    `demands`, `urges`, and `wishes`. Just as emotions frequently reverse peoples action, the subjunctive
    mood reverse the normal verb.

### 12. There's Problems With That!

- EXPLETIVE DELETED
- Expletive
  - an oath or swear word OR
  - a word or phrase used to fill out a sentence or a line of verse without adding to the sense.(There, it, that...)
- Basically, expletive constructions are phrases or sentences that begin
  with `There are`, `There is`, `It is`, `There were`, `There was`, or `It was`.
- These are also called `phantom subjects` - meaningless.
- Example

  - There were six people riding in our car. (INCORRECT/WEAK)
  - Six people were riding in our car. (CORRECT/STRONG)
  - It is a problem to suggest tax revolt. (INCORRECT/WEAK)
  - To suggest tax revolt is a problem. (CORRECT/STRONG)

- WEAK

  - There are whirling gizmos that attracted attention from every buyer.
  - There were some who negotiated fares better than 70 percent off retail price.
  - It is a big dissappointment to lose the game.
  - There are problems with retaining law firms over the internet.

- STRONGER

  - Whirling gizmos attracted attention from every buyer.
  - Some negotiated fares better than 70 percent off retail price.
  - Losing the game is big dissapointment.
  - Retaining law firms over the internet is problemetic.

- MEMORY TIP
  - These expletive words are comforting but meaningless.
  - Find the real subject, and select the verb accordingly.
