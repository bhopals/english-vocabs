- CHUNKING

  - There is another trick called "CHUNKING" while speaking/reading. It help us take a
    necessary pauses and sound more rythmatically while speaking.

  - WORD CHUNKS are a sequence of words that come naturally together to express an idea.
  - BENEFIT of CHUNKING

    - 1. The problem of having to think about each individual word.
    - 2. Chunk and Phrases group words that go together which can make you sound more fluent.
    - 3. Because these phrases also have a rythm of their own, they introduce great intonation
         and interst to your conversation.

  - HOW CHUNKING CAN BE DONE

    - 1. We understand `PHRASE` by `PHRASE`, so `KEEP PHRASES SHORT`

      - It is how long a person has to wait for a phrase to complete not how long a sentence is.

    - 2. Chunk by NOUN PHRASES and VERB PHRASES

      - A NOUN Phrase is the noun as the object of the sentence.
      - In VERB Phrase the Verb is the focus.

    - 3. When Speaking, Complete PHRASES as Quickly as Possible.

    - 4. When Experienced readers read a text they are able to recognize groups of words
         such as NOUN Phrases or VERB Phrases that go together to create meaning.

    - 5. Use FIXED and SEMI-FIXED Phrases!

      - They are an IMPORTANT tool for students if they are going to speak fluenty.

    - 6. Common Collocations are EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

      - These are collections of words that are normally seen together because that's the way they are used.
      - Examples
        - `heavy rain`, `light rain`, `weak coffee`, `the rich and famous`
        - NOTE: Don't say `strong rain`, `weak rain` - it should be `heavy rain`, `light rain`

    - 7.  Phrasal Verbs are also part of Fluent Speaker's armoury

      - Example
      - `to put down`, `to give up`

    - 8. IDIOMS

    - THAT IS WHAT CHUNKING IS MY FRIEND!
