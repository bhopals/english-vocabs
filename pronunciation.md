  - When you say a word and put your hand below your chin and pronounce the word.
    Now notice how many times your chin dropped? Well thats what the number of Syllables would be.

- 1. 2 SYLLABLE WROD PRONUNCIATION

- CHUNKING

  - There is another trick called "CHUNKING" while speaking/reading. It help us take a
    necessary pauses and sound more rythmatically while speaking.

  - WORD CHUNKS are a sequence of words that come naturally together to express an idea.
  - BENEFIT of CHUNKING

    - 1. The problem of having to think about each individual word.
    - 2. Chunk and Phrases group words that go together which can make you sound more fluent.
    - 3. Because these phrases also have a rythm of their own, they introduce great intonation
         and interst to your conversation.

  - HOW CHUNKING CAN BE DONE

    - 1. We understand `PHRASE` by `PHRASE`, so `KEEP PHRASES SHORT`

      - It is how long a person has to wait for a phrase to complete not how long a sentence is.

    - 2. Chunk by NOUN PHRASES and VERB PHRASES

      - A NOUN Phrase is the noun as the object of the sentence.
      - In VERB Phrase the Verb is the focus.

    - 3. When Speaking, Complete PHRASES as Quickly as Possible.

    - 4. When Experienced readers read a text they are able to recognize groups of words
         such as NOUN Phrases or VERB Phrases that go together to create meaning.

    - 5. Use FIXED and SEMI-FIXED Phrases!

      - They are an IMPORTANT tool for students if they are going to speak fluenty.

    - 6. Common Collocations are EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

      - These are collections of words that are normally seen together because that's the way they are used.
      - Examples
        - `heavy rain`, `light rain`, `weak coffee`, `the rich and famous`
        - NOTE: Don't say `strong rain`, `weak rain` - it should be `heavy rain`, `light rain`

    - 7.  Phrasal Verbs are also part of Fluent Speaker's armoury

      - Example
      - `to put down`, `to give up`

    - 8. IDIOMS

    - THAT IS WHAT CHUNKING IS MY FRIEND!

- non-stressed vowels except the one that is STRESSED, should be pronoused as shwa (neutral - ə) sound

  - Examples
    - Police - Pə`li`ce
    - Children - `Chi`ldrəm
    - Americano - əme`ri`cano
    - Artificial - /ˌärdəˈfiSHəl/
    - Commercial - /kçˈmərSHəl/

- Cant - caant
- Copy - cəpi
- I am really in hot water with my teacher
- I will be in really hot water with my parents

### Linking Sound

#### RULE #1

- Consonant + Vowel Blend
- When a Word ends with a CONSONANT and next word starts with a VOWEL, the sounds can be BLENDED
- Example
  - hol`d o`n ==> holdon
  - slee`p i`n ==> sleepin
  - Hol` d o``n a  ` second! Can you pi`ck u`p some milk fo` r u``s a `t the store?
    ==> Hol`dona` second! Can you pi`ckup` some milk fo`rusa`t the store?
  - She i` s a``n o `ld frien`d o`f mine ==> Sheisanold friendof mine

#### RULE #2

- Same or Similar Sound
- Make them one sound not the two separate sound
- Make it little bit longer
- Example
  - This style ==> thisstyle
  - need to ==> needto
  - I think thi`s` `s`ong is abou`t` `t`he singers blac`k` `c`at
    ==> I think thi`ss`ong is abou`tt`he singers bla`ck`at
  - You do not nee`d t`o prov`e i`t to them => you do not needto provito them

#### RULE #3

- Flap `t`, `d`

  - Vowel + t, d + vowel - (d`a`"dd"`y`)
  - r + t, d + vowel - (pa`r`"t"`y`)

  - Examples

    - Ho`w` "d"`o` you know th`a`"t" `i`s your book?
      => `w` is not vowel, but we go with the sound of `w` which is vowel sound hence the `d` will be a FLAP `d`
      => same goes for "t". It is between `a` and `i`, hence a FLAP `t` will be pronounced.
      ==> how do you know thatis your book.

    - A l`o`"t" `o`f girls wouldn'`t e`ve`n n`otice, b`u`"t" `I` am n`o`"t" `a` l`o`"t" `o`f girls.
      => A lo`t` `o`f girls wouldn'`te`ve`nn`otice, butI am nota lotof girls.

#### RULE #4

- Unreleased Plosive Consonants
- Plosive Consonants (t,d,p,b,k,g) + CONSONANTS
  :The sound can be unreleased.
- When Plosive Consonants are placed right before the constant, the sound can be unreleased.
- Unreleased means when you pronounce them you need to speak half the sound and stop and move to the next consonant.
- Example

  - woul`d` `b`e ==> woul`db`e
  - stuc`k` `l`i`ke`(k sound) `th`is ==> stuc`kl`ikethis
  - We allowe`d` `t`he m to jum`p` `t`o the fron`t` (RULE#1) `o`f the line
    => We allowe`dth`em to jump`to` the fron`to`f the line.

  - I jus`t` `d`on'`t` `w`an`t` `m`y kids to ma`ke`(K Sound) `th`e same ba`d` `m`istake`s` (RULE#1) `I` made.
    ==> I jus`td`on't wan`tm`y kids to ma`keth`e same ba`dm`istake`sI` made.

#### RULE #5

- Consonant Cluster
- Consonant + t, d + Consonant
- `t, d` sounds can be dropped
- Example
  - ju`s`"t" `n`eed ==> jus(t)need==> jus need
  - diamo`n`"d" `r`ing => diamon(d)ring ==> diamon ring
  - La`s`"t" `c`hance boa`r`"d" `g`ame ==> Las(t)chance boar(d)game ==> las chance boar game
  - Wow, the first of the school and you are already behing
    ==> Wow the fir`s`"t" `d`ay of the schoo`l`(Rule#1) `a`nd you a`re`(R sound, Rule #1) `a`lready behind
    ==> Wow the fir(t) day of the schooland youarealready behind
    ==> Wow the fir day of the schooland youarealready behind

#### RULE #6

- Glottal Stop
- `t` and `n` sounds meet together
- :t sounds can be unreleased.
- It means when you pronounced the `t` sound, you need to speak it hald a sound and stop and move to the `n` sound.
- button ==> but`t`o`n` ==> /ˈbətn/ ==> bu/tn/
- curtain ==> cur`t`ai`n` ==> /ˈkərtn/ ==> cur/tn/
- Tell me how far you have got`t`e`n` ==> go/tn/
- important ==> importnt

#### RULE #7

- `th` sound right after the `n`, `s`, or `z` sound
  - `n`, `s`, or `z` + `th`
- In this case `th` can be dropped.
- Example
  - is that ==> is(th)at ==> is at
  - in there ==> in(th)ere ==> in ere
  - I guess that works for me
    - I gues`s` `th`at works for me
      ==> I guess(th)at works for me
      ==> I guess at works for me

#### RULE #8

- `nt` sounds between vowels
- VOWEL + nt + VOWEL
- :t sound can be dropped.
- Examples
  - International ==> `i`"nt"`e`rnational ==> in(t)ernational ==> inernational
  - Sentimental ==> S`e`"nt"`i`m`e`"nt"`a`l ==> Sen(t)imen(t)al ==> Senimenal
  - How on earth you can get to the international airport in an hour.
